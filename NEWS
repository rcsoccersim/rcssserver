[14.0.3]
  * Fixed a bug of the overtime handling when server::golden_goal is
    false. Thanks go to Thomas Gabel for reporting the problem.

[14.0.2]
  * Fixed a problem of automatic heterogeneous player assignment. Now,
    the player type ID of unchanged player is never broadcasted.

  * Fixed a compilation problem on gcc-4.4.1. Thanks go to Ke Shi for
    reporting the problem.

[14.0.1]
  * Fixed an incorrect catch model implementation. Thanks go to Bruno
    Vinicius for reporting the problem. The following pseudo code
    shows a corrected trade-off rule of the catch model:

     // catchable_area_l_stretch is the heterogeneous parameter,
     // currenlty within [1.0,1.3]
     double this_catchable_are_delta
       = server::catchable_area_l * ( catchable_area_l_stretch - 1.0 );
     double this_catchable_area_l_max =   server::catchable_area_l
                                        + this_catchable_are_delta;
     double this_catchable_area_l_min =   server::catchable_area_l
                                        - this_catchable_are_delta;

     if ( ball_pos is inside the MINIMAL catch area )
     {
       // the MINIMAL catch area has a length of
       // this_catchable_area_l_min and width server::catchable_area_w
       //
       // goalie catches the ball with probability
       // server::catch_probability (which is 1.0 by default)
     }
     else if ( ball_pos is beyond the MAXIMAL (stretched) area )
     {
       // the MAXIMAL catch area has a length of
       // this_catchable_area_l_max and width server::catchable_area_w
       //
       // goalie definitely misses the ball
     }
     else
     {
        double ball_relative_x = ( ball_pos - goalie_pos )
                                 .rotate( -(goalie_body + catch_dir) ).x;
        double catch_prob
          = server::catch_probability
            - server::catch_probability
              *   ( ball_relative_x - this_catchable_area_l_min )
                / ( this_catchable_area_l_max - this_catchable_area_l_min );
        // goalie catches the ball with probability catch_prob
        // it holds: catch_prob is in [0.0,1.0]
     }

[14.0.0]
  * New parameters:
    - server::tackle_rand_factor (default value: 2.0)
    - server::foul_detect_probability (default value: 0.5)
    - server::foul_exponent (default value: 10.0)
    - server::foul_cycles (default value: 5)
    - server::golden_goal (default value: true)
    - player::kick_power_rate_delta_min (default value: 0.0)
    - player::kick_power_rate_delta_max (default value: 0.0)
    - player::foul_detect_probability_delta_factor (default value: 0.0)
    - player::catchable_area_l_stretch_min (default value: 1.0)
    - player::catchable_area_l_stretch_max (default value: 1.3)

  * Changed parameters:
    - server::stamina_capacity (148600.0 -> 130600.0)
    - server::dash_angle_step (90.0 -> 45.0)
    - server::side_dash_rate (0.25 -> 0.4)
    - server::back_dash_rate (0.5 -> 0.6)

  * Improvement of the dash model. The new server::dash_angle_step
    value enables players to dash into eight directions. The value of
    server::side_dash_rate and server::back_dash_rate are increased to
    enable more acceleration in sideward/backward dashes.

  * Improvement of the stamina model. The stamina capacity value is
    changed from 148600.0 to 130600.0.

  * Increasing tackle noise. server::tackle_rand_factor parameter is
    introduced and, consequently, each heterogeneous player type has
    an independent tackle_rand parameter. With this parameter, the
    noise of tackle effect is increased more than kicking noise. Each
    heterogeneous tackle_rand value is caluculated as follows:

      tackle_rand = kick_rand * server::tackle_rand_factor

  * Introducing fouls for dangerous tackle situations. If players
    perform a tackle command under specific conditions and the referee
    detects it, then the playmode is changed to

      foul_charge_[lr]

    where l or r is the side of the tackling player. After wait
    cycles, the play mode is changed to "free_kick_[lr]" or
    "indirect_free_kick_[lr]", where l or r is the side of ball
    handling player. When foul occurs in penalty areas,
      - if the side of penalty area is same as the penalized player's
        side, indirect free kick is awarded to the other team at the
        position where foul occurs.
      - else, the ball is moved to the outside of penalty
        area and free kick is awarded to the other team.

    Currently, the dangerous conditions are defined as follows:
      - The ball handling player exists between the tackling player
        and the ball.
      - The ball handling player's body angle is directed to the
        opposite side of the tackling player.
      - The ball handling player is performing dash command.
      - Finally, the foul is determined randomly using
        foul_detect_probability of each heterogeneous player type.

  * Introducing intentional foul option. Now, intentional foul playing
    and yellow/red cards are introduced. The tackle command is
    extended by an additional boolean parameter, i.e.

       (tackle DIR {true|false})

    which indicates that the player is willing to foul his
    opponent. If the boolean parameter is omitted, the false value is
    used by default.

    Details:

      a) if foul flag is false:
         normal tackle behavior, i.e. tackling for the ball
      b) if foul flag is true AND ball not in kick range of opponent:
         normal tackle behavior
      c) if foul flag is true AND ball IS in kick range of opponent:
        c1) tackle the ball, but apply a higher tackle exponent
            (server::foul_exponent = 10)
        c2) if the foul succeeds (with probability determined in c1):
            the foul-playing player does *not* have to remain idle
            for server::tackle_cycles cycles. but instead the opponent
            player (the player to which the foul has been applied) must
            remain idle (lie on the ground) for server::foul_cycles
            cycles.
        c3) if the foul succeeded:
            the referee detects the foul with probability
            foul_detect_probability.
            => free kick for other team
        c4) if the referee detected the foul AND the dangerous
            conditions specified in the previous section are met:
            => yellow card to the player AND free kick for other team
        c5) if the referee detected the foul AND the dangerous
            conditions are met AND the ball is in the penalty area
            where its side is same as the penalized player's side
            => yellow card to the player AND indirect free kick for
               other team
        c6) if player has two yellow cards:
            => red card to the player AND the player is disconnected
               from the Soccer Server

  * Red and Yellow cards. If an intentional and dangerous foul is
    detected, the referee penalizes the player and sends the yellow/red
    card message toclients. The message format is similar to playmode
    messages. Side and uniform number information of penalized player
    are appended to the card message:

      (referee TIME yellow_card_[lr]_[1-11])

     or

      (referee TIME red_card_[lr]_[1-11])

   * Foul information in sensory messages.
     - Players can receive their idling cycles caused by intentional
       foul and their card status every cycle by sense_body
       message. These information are appended after the previous
       format and are sent only to v14 or later clients.

         (sense_body TIME ....
           ...
           (foul (charged CYCLE) (card {none|yellow|red})))

       CYCLES is the number of cycles the current idling will last
       for, with 0 indicating that the player isn't idling.

       As well as sense_body message, players can receive all players'
       foul information by fullstate message:

         (fullstate TIME ...
           ...
           ((p {l|r} <unum> [g] <player_type_id>)
            <pos.x> <pos.y> <vel.x> <vel.y> <body_angle> <neck_angle>
            [ <point_dist> <point_dir>]
            (<stamina> <effort> <recovery> <capacity>)
           [t|k|f] [y|r])
           ...

       The character 'f'(indicates player is lying on the ground),
       'y'(indicates yellow card) or'r '(indicates red card) are
       appended to each player information.

     - Coaches can receive all players' idling and card status by
       see_global message. These information are sent only to v14 or
       later clients. As well as player's fullstate message, 'f', 'y'
       or 'r' are appended to each player information as follows:

         ((p "TEAM" UNUM[ goalie]) X Y VX VY BODY NECK[ ARM][ {t|k|f}][ {y|r}])

     - New player state flags, FOUL_CHARGED, YELLOW_CARD and RED_CARD,
       are introduced to record/send players' status to game log or
       monitor clients.

  * Introducing heterogeneous goalie. Online coaches now can change
    the player type of goalie. The 'catchable_area_l_stretch' variable
    is added to each heterogeneous player type. The value is
    caluculated as follows:

      double delta = random( player::catchable_area_l_stretch_min,
                             player::catchable_area_l_stretch_max );
      catchable_area_l_stretch = delta;

    As a trade-off, such a goalie would have a reduced catch success
    reliability according to:

      double default_catchable_area_l = server::catchable_area_l;
      double this_catchable_area_l = default_catchable_area_l * catchable_area_l_stretch;

      if ( ball_pos is inside the default catch area )
      {
        // goalie catches the ball with probability server::catch_probability
      }
      else if ( ball_pos is beyond the stretched area )
      {
        // goalie definitely misses the ball
      }
      else
      {
        double ball_relative_x = ( ball_pos - goalie_pos ).rotate( -(goalie_body + catch_dir) ).x;
        double catch_prob
          = server::catch_probability
            - server::catch_probability * ( ball_relative_x - server::catchable_area_l )
                                          / ( this_catchable_area_l - default_catchable_area_l );
        // goalie catches the ball with probability catch_prob
      }

    And, now, the information of goalie's player type id is sent to
    players with fullstate message. If players connect as v14 or later
    client, they can receive the following player information in the
    fullstate message:

      (p {l|r} <unum> [g] <player_type_id>)

  * Introducing heterogeneous kick power rate. The variable of
    'kick_power_rate' and 'foul_detect_probability' are added to each
    heterogeneous player type. These values are calculated as follows:

      delta = random( player::kick_power_rate_delta_min,
                      player::kick_power_rate_delta_max )
      kick_power_rate = server::kick_power_rate + delta
      foul_detect_probability = server::foul_detect_probability
                                + player::foul_detect_probability_delta_fact * delta

   In this trade-off, we assume that a player who is rather strong
   (and, thus, can shoot very strongly), is not very smart (and, thus,
   cannot very well deceive the referee when doing a foul).

   Since the introduction of foul is a new feature to be added, we do
   *not* change the kick power rate actually in v14 in order to
   provide a migration period to teams. So, the above parameters are
   set to 0. These parameters will be changed in v15 or later.

  * Golden goal option. The new switch option, 'server::golden_goal',
    determines when the game finishes in extra halves. If
    server::golden_goal is true and the goal is scored in extra
    halves, the game finishes immediately. If server::golden_goal is
    false, the game is continued during all extra halves even if the
    goal is scored. This option is introduced to enable more flexible
    competition scheme.

[13.2.2]
  * Fixed a bug of the player clearance from the ball.

  * Fixed a bug of the back passer update in the referee module.

  * Fixed a bug that offense side players are cleared from the ball
    in back_pass_? and catch_fault_? playmode.

[13.2.1]
  * Added the missing comma in CSVSaver. Thanks go to Andreas
    Hechenblaickner for reporting the problem.

[13.2.0]
  * Changed parameters:
    - server::synch_see_offset (30 -> 0)
    - server::pen_max_extra_kicks (10 -> 5)
    - server::pen_before_setup_wait (30 -> 10)
    - server::pen_ready_wait (50 -> 10)
    - server::pen_setup_wait (100 -> 70)
    - server::pen_taken_wait (200 -> 150)

  * Fixed a timer bug of the penalty kick referee.

[13.1.1]
  * Fixed a bug of the indirect free kick referee.

  * Fixed incorrect online coach names for result savers. Thanks
    go to Andreas Hechenblaickner for reporting the problem.

  * Fixed gcc-4.4 compilation problems. Thanks go to Hedayat Vatankhah
    providing the patch.

[13.1.0]
  * Fixed a defect of a new dash model. Now, a dash direction is
    discretized before calculating a dash power effectiveness.
    For example, if server::dash_angle_step is 90, the command
    "(dash 100 40)" is equivalent to "(dash 100	0)" and the command
    "(dash 100 46)" is equivalent to "(dash 100	90)". Thanks go to
    Holger Endert for reporting the problem.

  * On Cygwin, replaced the player command parser generated by
    flex/bison with the hand-coded parser, in order to avoid the
    defect of Cygwin's flex/bison.

  * The configure script supported the FLEX environment variable, that
    can specify a certain flex command location.

[13.0.2]
  * Fixed a ball catcher bug that causes a strange penalty shoot outs
    play. Thanks go to Ke Shi for reporting the problem.

[13.0.1]
  * Fixed build problems with bison 2.4

  * Fixed defects on FreeBSD and MacOSX.

  * Supported cygwin.

  * Changed the default configuration file location on Windows. Now,
    configuration files are generated under the rcssserver's working
    folder.

  * Fixed defects of the directory creation. Now, rcssserver can
    create a nested directory for configuration files or log files.

  * Fixed defects of the team graphic broadcasting. Now, team graphic
    messages are sent to all monitors connected after coaches.

  * Now, an offline coach receive an error messag if an offline
    coach tries to connect without coach mode.

  * Added a header line to the first CSVSaver output.

[13.0.0]
  * RCSSBase is now integrated into RCSSServer. It is not necessary
    for you to install RCSSBase before the RCSSServer installation.

  * New parameters:
    - server::stamina_capacity (default value: 148600.0)
    - server::max_dash_angle (default value: 180.0)
    - server::min_dash_angle (default value: -180.0)
    - server::dash_angle_step (default value: 90.0)
    - server::side_dash_rate (default value: 0.25)
    - server::back_dash_rate (default value: 0.5)
    - server::max_dash_power (default value: 100.0)
    - server::min_dash_power (default value: -100.0)

  * Changed parameters:
    - server::stamina_max (4000 -> 8000)
    - server::max_back_tackle_power (50.0 -> 0.0)
    - server::extra_half_time (300 -> 100)
    - server::player_speed_max (1.2 -> 1.05)
    - server::player_speed_max_min (0.8 -> 0.75)
    - server::extra_stamina (0.0 -> 50.0)
    - player::player_decay_delta_min (-0.05 -> -0.1)
    - player::extra_stamina_delta_max (100.0 -> 50.0)
    - player::effort_mix_delta_factor (-0.002 -> -0.004)
    - player::effort_man_delta_factor (-0.002 -> -0.004)
    - player::new_dash_power_rate_delta_min (-0.0005 -> -0.0012)
    - player::new_dash_power_rate_delta_max (0.0015 -> 0.0008)

  * Changed a stamina model. The new parameter
    server::stamina_capacity defines the maximum recovery capacity for
    each player. When player's stamina is recovered during the game,
    his stamina capacity is also consumed. If the player's stamina
    capacity becomes 0, his stamina is never recovered and he can use
    only his extra stamina. The recovery policy of the stamina
    capacity is as follows:

     - normal halves
       The stamina capacity is reset to the initial value just after
       the kick off as well as the other stamina related variables.

     - extra halves and penalty shootouts
       The stamina capacity is reset to the initial value just after
       normal halves if the game is not over, but is never recovered
       at the half time and before the penalty shootouts.

    If server::stamina_capacity is set to a negative value, players
    have an infinite stamina capacity. This setting makes the new
    stamina model completely same as the old stamina model.

  * Changed a dash model. Players can now add the dash direction as
    the second argument of his dash command:

      `(dash <power> <dir>)'

    The dash direction is relative to player's body angle (or reverse
    side angle if dash power is negative value) and is restricted
    within [server::min_dash_angle,server::max_dash_angle]. The dash
    power effectiveness is affected by the magnitude of dash
    angle. Players can dash in direction of their body (or reverse
    side angle if dash power is negative) using 100% of power, in
    backward with server::back_dash_rate(0.5) of power and in sideward
    with server::side_dash_rate(0.25) of power. The dash power
    effectiveness will increase between sides and body direction from
    server::side_dash_rate(0.25) to 1.0 and between sides and backward
    from server::side_dash_rate(0.25) to server::back_dash_rate(0.5).

    dir_rate = ( fabs( dir ) > 90.0
                 ? back_dash_rate - ( back_dash_rate - side_dash_rate )
                                      * ( 1.0 - ( fabs( dir ) - 90.0 ) / 90.0 )
                 : side_dash_rate + ( 1.0 - side_dash_rate )
                                      * ( 1.0 - fabs( dir ) / 90.0 ) );

    Please note that server::min_dash_power will be set to 0 in the
    future simulator (v14 or later). This means the negative dash
    power will be forbidden completely.

    In order to balance with older binaries and to enable flexible
    settings, server::dash_angle_step parameter has been
    introduced. This parameter defines the discreteness of player's
    dash direction. If server::dash_angle_step is 90.0, players can
    dash only in four directions (forward, backward and two
    sidewards).

  * Changed heterogeneous player parameters. Now, heterogeneous
    players' dash speed become slower.

  * Forbad a backward tackle. Now, server::max_back_tackle_power is
    set to 0. This means the tackle command directed to 180.0 degree
    has no effect.

  * Changed an overtime length. Now, the default overtime length
    is set to 1000 cycles.

  * Supported a protocol version 13.

    - All new parameters are sent to v.13 or later clients.

    - server::extra_half_time parameter is now sent to v.13 or later
      clients.

    - Version 13+ players and coaches can see players' kicking state.

      When players can see another players team, they can also see if
      that player is kicking via a `k' flag as follows:

        `((p "<TEAMNAME>" <UNUM>) <DIST> <DIR> <DISTCHG> <DIRCHG>
                                 <BDIR> <HDIR> [<POINTDIR>] [{t|k}])'

        `((p "<TEAMNAME>") <DIST> <DIR> [<POINTDIR>] [{t|k}])'

      Coach visuals now can indicate if a player is kicking via a `k'
      flag as follows:

        `((p "<TEAMNAME>" <UNUM>) <X> <Y> <VEL_X> <VEL_Y> <ANGLE>
                                  <NECK_ANGLE> [<ARM_DIR>] [{t|k}])'

      If an observed player is tackling, the kicking flag is always
      overwritten by the tackle flag.

      Please note that the kicking state can be seen within one cycle
      just after kicking.

    - The stamina capacity information is added to sense_body message
      as follows:

        `(stamina <STAMINA> <EFFORT> <CAPACITY>)`

  * Supported a monitor protocol version 4 and a game log format
    version 5. In these versions, players' stamina capacity
    information are contained in each player data. Now, these versions
    are used by default.

  * Now, stoppage time information is recorded in the text log(.rcl)
    files.

  * Supported the environment variable RCSS_CONF_DIR. With this
    variable, you can specify the default location of configuration
    files.

[12.1.5]
  * Fixed build problems with boost::system.

[12.1.4]
  * Fixed library dependencies and a problem in 64bit platforms.
    Thanks go to Hedayat Vatankhah for providing the patches.

[12.1.3]
  * This release is the version for the final round of RoboCup2008.

  * Added new parameter, server::extra_half_time(default: 300). This
    parameter changes the length of each extra half. Please note that,
    at least in this release, rcssserver never send
    server::extra_half_time to v.12 or older clients via the
    server_param message.

[12.1.2]
  * Fixed gcc 4.3 compilation problems. Thanks go to Hedayat Vatankhah
  for providing the patch.

  * Fixed gcc 4.4 warnings.

[12.1.1]
  * Fixed an endless loop bug in the collision check with goal
    posts. Thanks go to Alexander Burger for reporting the
    problem.

  * Fixed defects of the back pass rule.
    - Now, the back pass rule does not apply if goalie catches the
      ball after his own kick but the previous ball kicker is an
      opponent player and both kicks are performed within the same
      play_on period.

    - Now, the back pass rule applies if a teammate player holds the
      ball and kicks the ball just after goalie's catch in the same
      cycle.

    - Fixed a defect of timer count when trainer changes the playmode.

[12.1.0]
  * Slightly changed the game log format version 4. Now, players'
    pointing points are recorded by the global value of left-hand
    coordinate system.

  * The size of team_graphic image can be smaller than 256x64. Any xpm
    graphic that the size is 8*m x 8*n (0<m<=32,0<n<=8) is acceptable.

  * Now, team_graphic messages are always recorded in the game log
    file as msg info.

  * Now, the game date and result are recorded at the end of the game
    log file as msg info.

  * Fixed a defect of log file flushing.

  * Disabled the stdoutsaver by default. Instead, the rcsoccersim
    script will try to load the stdoutsaver module.

  * Fixed an incorrect result message of penalty shootouts in
    stdoutsaver.

[12.0.1]
  * Fixed a change_view command bug in the synchronous mode. Thanks go
    to Tobias Springenbergr for reporting the problem and providing
    the patch.

[12.0.0]
  * Supported the monitor protocol version 3 and the game log format
    version 4. Now, these are used by default.

  * Fixed a build problem on some platforms.

[12.0.0_pre-20080210]

  * New parameter:
    - server::synch_see_offset (default value: 30)

  * Renamed parameter:
    - server::min_tackle_power -> server::max_back_tackle_power
      (default value: 50.0)

  * Changed parameters:
    - server::tackle_power_rate (0.0135 -> 0.027)
    - server::tackle_back_dist (0.5 -> 0.0)
    - server::tackle_width (1.0 -> 1.25)

  * New command:
    - "(synch_see)"
      All version players can use this command. If the command is
      accepted, rcssserver sent a reply message, "(ok synch_see)".
      This command is used for a synchronous mode describing below.

  * Changed a see message timer. There are 2 modes for all players,
    the asynchronous mode and the synchronous mode. The asynchronous
    mode is completely same as v.11 or older timer and is a default
    mode for all players including v.12 players. If players send the
    "(synch_see)" command, they enter to the synchronous mode and
    cannot return to the asynchronous mode. v.11 or older players
    also can use this command and the synchronous mode.

    In the synchronous mode, the "low" view quality cannot be used and
    the following view width are available:

      | mode    | view width(degree) | see frequency  |
      | narrow  | 60                 | every cycle    |
      | normal  | 120                | every 2 cycles |
      | wide    | 180                | every 3 cycles |

    In all view modes, rcssserver send see messages at
    server::synch_see_offset(30) ms from the beginning of the cycle.

    Each view width can be calculated as follows:

      narrow:  60 = visible_angle(90) * send_step(150) / sim_step(100)
      normal: 120 = narrow * 2
      wide:   130 = narrow * 3

  * Changed a tackle model for v.12 players based on the Thomas
    Gabel's proposal. Now, the argument of the tackle command sent by
    v.12 players means the ball acceleration angle relative to the
    player's body angle. Effective power for tackle(angle) is
    calculated as follows:

      eff_power = ( max_back_tackle_power
                    + ( max_tackle_power - max_back_tackle_power )
                    * ( 1 - fabs( angle )/PI ) )
                * tackle_power_rate

  * Changed a tackle power restriction rule for the v.11 or older
    players as follows:

      power = max( -max_back_tackle_power,
                   min( max_tackle_power, power ) )

    This means a tackle power is restricted within [-50,100] in the
    default settings. Note that a backwards tackle might be completely
    forbidden (max_back_tackle_power is set to 0) in the v.13 or later
    simulator.

  * Added a tackle power reduction according to the ball position as
    follows:

      eff_power *= 1 - 0.5*( fabs( player_2_ball.th() )/PI

  * Changed a kick noise model. This change is motivated by the Mehrab
    Norouzitallab's proposal. Now, the maximum kick noise is directly
    proportional to the kick power, the ball distance, the ball
    direction and the ball speed. When the kick power is 0, the kick
    noise becomes always 0.

      pos_rate = 0.5 + 0.25*( dir_diff/PI + dist_2_bal/kickable_margin )
        For tackle: pos_rate = 0.5 + 0.5*( 1.0 - tackle_prob )
      speed_rate = 0.5
                 + 0.5*( ball_speed / (ball_speed_max*ball_decay) )
      max_rand = kick_rand
               * ( power / max_power )
               * ( pos_rate + speed_rate )
      kick_noise = polar2vector( rand( 0, max_rand ),
                                 rand(-PI,PI) )

  * Added an automatic version check for configuration files. If
    configuration files do not contain a version parameter that is
    same as the rcssserver's release version, rcssserver will exit
    with error messages.

  * (Not fixed yet) Supported the monitor protocol version 3 and the
    game log format version 4. From these versions, data is
    represented by human readable text messages. The default version
    of game log format is still 3 in 12.0.0_pre-20080210 because the
    format has not been fixed yet and the implementation has not been
    completed yet.

  * (Test version) Introduced a new catch model based on the
    Sebastian Marian's proposal. The catch probability is set to
    unreliable catches. If ball is not within the goalie's reliable
    catch area, the catch probability is calculated according to the
    ball position and the goalie's catch command might be failed.

    Note that this rule is not actually used in the default
    settings of v.12 server. If you try to test this rule, you need
    to change the server::catchable_area_l(default value: 1.2)
    parameter to the value greater than
    server::reliable_catch_area_l(default value: 1.2). And
    server::min_catch_probability(default value: 1) also need to be
    change to [0, 1]. RCSSServer can read these parameter from
    server.conf, but does not send them to clients.

[12.0.0_pre-20071217]
  * Supported a protocl version 12. Now, players and coaches can
    connect as a version 12 client. In the version 12 protocol,

    - Players can change view width only to normal or wide and cannot
      change the view quality. Instead of them, players can receive
      see messeage at the begining of every cycle if their view width
      is normal. If players' view width is wide, see message is
      received once every two cycles. The new message arrival order is
      as follows:

      sense_body (-> fullstate) -> hear -> see

    - The new variation of change_view command is supported. Now,
      player can send the following format change_view command:

      (change_view <ViewWidth>)

      If version 11 or older players send this format command, their
      view quality is set to high.

    - Collision information is added to the sense_body message. The
      following format message is appended to the end of sense_body:

      (collision {none|[(ball)][(player)][(post)]})

      For example, version 12 players may receive the following
      message.

      (sense_body 0 (view_mode high normal) (stamina 4000 1)
        (speed 0 0) (head_angle 0) (kick 0) (dash 0) (turn 0) (say 0)
        (turn_neck 0) (catch 0) (move 0) (change_view 0)
        (arm (movable 0) (expires 0) (target 0 0) (count 0))
        (focus (target none) (count 0)) (tackle (expires 0) (count 0))
        (collision (ball) (player)))

  * New parameters:
    - server::extra_stamina (default value: 0.0)
    - server::max_tackle_power (default value: 100.0)
    - server::min_tackle_power (default value: 0.0)
    - server::player_speed_max_min (default value: 0.8)
    - server::max_monitors (default value: -1)
    - player::allow_mult_default_type (default value: false)

  * Changed parameters:
    - server::ball_speed_max (2.7 -> 3.0)
    - server::catchable_area_l (2.0 -> 1.2)
    - server::kick_rand (0 -> 0.1)
    - server::tackle_power_rate (0.027 -> 0.0135)
    - player::player_types (7 -> 18)
    - player::pt_max (3 -> 1)
    - player::kick_rand_delta_factor (0.5 -> 1)
    - player::kickable_margin_delta_max (0.2 -> 0.1)2
    - player::kickable_margin_delta_min (0 -> -0.1)
    - player::new_dash_power_rate_delta_max (0.002 -> 0.0015)
    - player::new_dash_power_rate_delta_min (0 -> -0.0005)
    - player::new_stamina_inc_max_delta_factor (-10000 -> -6000)
    - player::player_decay_delta_max (0.2 -> 0.1)
    - player::player_decay_delta_min (0 -> -0.05)

  * Now, the player's maximum dash speed is restricted within
    server::player_speed_max_min(0.8) and
    server::palyer_speed_max(1.2). In the heterogeneous player
    generation procedure, if the generated player type can run faster
    than server::player_speed_max or cannot run faster than
    server::player_speed_max_min, rcssserver rejects that type and try
    to regenerate another one.

  * The default value of player::player_types parameter is changed to
    18, and the default value of player::pt_max paremter is changed to
    1. Now, the restriction of player::pt_max is also applied to the
    default player type. This means that all field players have to be
    changed to the non-default type because the type of goalie cannot
    be changed. If server::allow_mult_default_type is false and teams
    use the default player type more than player::pt_max, rcssserver
    automatically assign the heterogeneous player type to field
    players just before the playmode is changed to kick-off.

  * Added a new restriction to the player substitution. Now, the
    online coach can substitute a same player type within
    player::pt_max times. This restriction is not applied to the
    default player type. If player::pt_max is 1, each player type
    except the default type can be used only once.

  * Slightly changed a noise model for movable objects. The new
    formula is as follows:

      double maxrnd = rand_param * speed;
      PVector noise = polar2vector( drand( 0.0, maxrnd ),
                                    drand( -PI, PI ) );

  * Changed a kick noise model. Now, the current ball speed affects
    the maximum kick noise value. Note that the maximum kick noise
    value has no effects if player's kick_rand parameter is 0.

      double maxrnd = kick_rand
                * kick_power / max_power
                * ( 1.0
                    + 0.25*(dir_diff/PI + dist_2_ball/kickable_margin)
                    + 0.5*(ball_speed/(ball_speed_max * ball_decay)) )
      PVector kick_noise = polar2vector( drand( 0.0, maxrnd ),
                                         drand( -PI, PI ) );

  * The tackle power sent by player's command is restricted within
    server::min_tackle_power and server::max_tackle_power. This means
    the backward tackle is forbidden now.

  * Changed a back pass rule. Now, an indirect free kick is taken
    after the back pass at the location where the back pass
    occured. Note that an indirect free kick can be started within
    penalty areas.

  * Changed a catch fault rule. Now, direct free kick is taken after
    the catch fault.

  * Now, goalie cannot catch the ball just after his kick. In such a
    case, back_pass_[lr] is taken.

  * Now, player's stamina, effort and recovery are never recovered at
    the half time in the extra halves.

  * Now, rcssserver accepts some coach commands from monitor clients
    if coach mode is enabled.

  * If server::max_monitor is a positive value, the total number of
    monitor clients that can connect to the rcssserver is restricted
    within that number. If server::max_monitor is a negative
    value(default), there is no restriction.

[11.1.2]
  * Fixed a bug in the offside referee.

[11.1.1]
  * Fixed a bug related to the boost::random.

  * Fixed a bug in the offside referee.

  * Fixed a problem in the module path string configuration.

[11.1.0]
  * Just updated a minor version number. Official relasese for the
	RoboCup2007.

[11.0.5]
  * Supported a client protocol version 10 and 11. There are no
    difference between version 9 and 10. If the clients connect as a
    version 11 client, server_param message contains new parameters,
    'ball_stuck_area' and 'coach_msg_file'. And, if the file specified
    by 'coach_msg_file' exists, version 11 coaches receive the external
    message contained by the 'coach_msg_file'.

  * Changed the format of the external message format for the coach
    client. Now,included data is sent by the following format:

     (include <BYTES> <DATA>)

  e.g.

     (include 4 test)
     (include 26 ((name LEFT) 5 3 1 1 12 2))
     (include 30 ((team LEFT) (team RIGHT) 2 1))

  <BYTES> means the byte size of <DATA>. So, We can also send a binary
  data to the coaches.

  * Fixed first two problems in the penalty kick(#1720067). Thanks go
    to Ralf Berger for reporting the problem and providing the patch.

  * Fixed third problem in #1720067. Now, if the defending team player
    kicks the ball, penalty_foul() is called immediately and the score
    is awarded to the taker team. Thanks go to Ralf Berger for
    reporting the problem.

  * Fiexed a penalty kick bug that the goalie can catch the ball
    anywhere.

  * Fixed a rule about goalie catch fault and back pass. Now, if the
    goalie catches the ball outside the penalty area, catch_fault_[lr]
    is called and an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposite
    team at the ball caught point after CATCH_FAULT_WAIT(30) cycles.

  * Fixed bugs in the gzip compressor/decompressor reset operation.

[11.0.4]
  * Fixed a defect in the random number generation.

[11.0.3]
  * Fixed a goal kick rule. Now, any opposite side players must not
   kick or touch the ball while goal kick mode. If opposite side
   players kick or touch the ball before the ball goes out of the
   penalty area, referee awards a goal kick again.

  * Fixed a bug about trainer initialization.

[11.0.2]
   * Fixed a defect of game logging.

[11.0.1]
   * Fixed a problem of boost::uniform_real on some platform.

[11.0.0]
   * Supported 64-bits OS.

   * Added automatic drop ball for the ball stuck situation. New
     server parameter 'ball_stuck_area' has been introduced. If
     playmode is play_on and ball is within ball_stuck_area distance
     for 'drop_ball_time' cycles, referee will drop the ball at the
     current ball position.

   * Added new server parameter 'coach_msg_file'. If this option is
     given, data conatined by the specified file is sent to coaches as
     one of the initial messages. Coaches must connect as the client
     version 11 or later.

   * Fixed trainer's hear message format.

   * Fixed a goal kick bug. Now, any player cannot dribble while goal
     kick modes.

[10.0.7]
   * Fixed defect introduced by fixing defect #1235909

[10.0.6]
   * Fixed defect #1235909 bug in parsing of unquoted player say messages.
     Thanks go to Ma Jie and Yang Fan for reporting this bug.

   * Fixed defect #1235911 in parsing 'and' conditionals within CLang.  Thanks
     go to Sina Iravanian for reporting this bug.

[10.0.5]
   * Fixed build/install issue which cause libraries not to be found

   * Fixed configure bug which cause configure to hang on rpm macro expansion

[10.0.4]
  * Fixed defect #1222134 in which the kickable area used to decide possession
    in KeepawayRef was too small.  Also changed the number of consecutive
    cycles in which a taker must touch the ball to declare a turnover from 5
    to 4.

  * Fixed compilation problems on with gcc 3.4.  Thanks go to Alexander
    Ferrein for providing a patch.

  * Fixed gcc 4.0 build problems

  * Fixed crash on exit when using libcsvsaver

[10.0.3]
  * Fixed defect #1182281 which resulted in linking problem with playerparam
    library.  Thanks go to HuangZhuo and Ma Jie for reporting this problem
    and testing the fix.

  * Fixed defect #1183388 which resulted in all .conf files containing server
    parameters, rather then the parameters they are supposed to contain.
    Thanks go to Thomas Gabel for reporting this defect.

  * Fixed defect #1183390 which caused the server crash when parsing CLang
    messages. Thanks go to Thomas Gabel for reporting this defect.

  * Fixed possible memory leak in coach parser.  Hopfully this will fix defect
    #754241 reported by Brian Tanner a very long time ago.  Thanks go to Brian
    Tanner for reporting this and to Pat Riley for suggesing the possible
    cause.

  * Fixed part one of defect #773792 in which the ball speed is not set to
    zero when heterogeneous players with a non-zero kick_rand parameter
    violate the FreeKickFault rule, and as a result (of the non-zero ball
    speed) the server changed the playmode to play_on immediately.  This was
    caused by ball noise being added to the ball after the FreeKickFault was
    called.  Thanks go to Hidehisa Akiyama for reporting this problem and for
    providing a very useful analysis of the defect.

  * Fixed part two of defect #773792 in which a FreeKickFault would not be
    called if the kick taker kicks the ball and then collides with the ball
    without dashing and subsequently dashes into the ball or kicks the ball
    before any other player.  Thanks go to Hidehisa Akiyama for reporting this
    problem and for providing a very useful analysis of the defect.

[10.0.2]
  * Fixed default value for half_time.  If the
    ~/rcssserver/server.conf was created with a defective version of
    the server, then you will need to either remove your
    ~/rcssserver/server.conf or replace the line

      server::half_time = 30

    with

      server::half_time = 300

    in order to set the half_time length to 3000 cycles.

  * Removed debugging output that occurred when players issue move
    commands.

  * Fixed bug that prevented online coaches from connecting.  The
    server would report that there was no serialiser for the version
    specified by the online coach.

[10.0.1]
  * Requires RCSSBase 10.0.9

  * The configuration parser library from RCSSBase now allows '-' or
    '--' before the options. This means the following three commands are
    the same:

    	`rcssserver server::port=6000`
   	`rcssserver -server::port=6000`
    	`rcssserver --server::port=6000`

  * The configuration parser now directly supports module loading (as
    opposed to the server::module option) via the "load=<libname>",
    "setpath=<path>" and "addpath=<path>" options.  The
    "server::module" and "server::module_path" options are no longer
    supported.  If the library cannot be loaded, a list of available
    modules will be listed, so long as rcssmodtest (from rcssbase) is
    in your path, othewise you can get a list of available modules
    via the --help option (see below).

  * The new parser also supports a new help option.  run

        `rcssserver --help`

    for details.  Each namespace provides it's own help information
    via the

	`--<namespace>::help`

    option, where <namespace> is the namespace you require help with.

    Help for a particular module can on be displayed if that module
    has been loaded.  You can load the module and display it's help
    information by using

    	`--load="<libname>" --<namespace>::help`,

    where <libname> is the name of the module you wish to load.  If you
    don't know what namespace the module uses, it will be listed if you
    use

	`--load="<libname>" --help`.

  * Fixed bug that would prevent (on certain platforms) modules from
    being found when the server was installed.

  * Fixed OS X build issues

[10.0.0]
  * Requires RCSSBase 10.0.8

  * The configuration script will now look for a RCSSBASE enviroment
  variable and set the approriate flags to look for the rcssbase
  libraries, headers and exes in the location specified by rcssbase.
  For instance, if rcssbase was configured with a prefix of $HOME,
  then you should configure rcsssever with RCSSBASE equal to $HOME.

  * Modules are now installed into PREFIX/lib/rcssserver/modules and
  server::module_dir paramter should be set to PREFIX/lib/rcssserver/modules,
  where PREFIX is the installation prefix (/usr/local by default or
  /usr if you are using rpms).  You can then specify what modules
  should be loaded by using the server::module parameter (do not include the
  suffix for the library).  The only exception to this is the synctimer and
  stdtimer modules.  In this case the correct module is loaded based on the
  value of server::sync_mode parameter.

  * Fixed defects regarding the slow_down_factor parameter which could alter
  the length of a half or cause the simulator to crash if set too high.

  * Fixed build problems on OS X. The file created in the build directory runs
  but haven't tested beyond that. The installed version has problems
  running because it can find load the modules.  Very strange.  The best
  approach at this stage is to install (so the modules go into the right
  place), but use the exectuable from the build directory.

  * Fixed build problems on Solaris 9. It has a similar problem to the OS X
  build, but it can at least load the std timer.  The version in the build
  directory can load all modules.  The sample client does not build with a
  ncurses interface and `--without-ncurses` must be used during configure.

[9.4.5]
  * Fixed defects in penatly shootouts.  Now if automatic player
  placement is on, only the players out of place are moved.

  * Fixed defect in locating the configuration directory on windows
  systems without cygwin installed.  The config files will now go
  into "My Documents/.rcssserver" on all windows systems.

[9.4.4]
  * Fixed defect that send "halfTime()" to players at half_time,
  rather than "half_time".

  * Fixed defect that would set the ball to not caught immediately
  after it was caught, thus preventing goalies from moving with the
  ball.

[9.4.3]
  * Fixed defect in penalty shootout procedure that made it impossible
  to score when opponent team didn't had a goalkeeper on the field.

  * Fixed defect that called the kickTaken callback instead of the
  ballCaught callback of the referees.

  * Fixed defect that allowed indirect kicks to be circumvented by
  waiting for a drop ball.  Now if a drop ball is awarded, the team
  that was given the indirect free kick cannot score unless the ball
  touches two of it's players or an opponent or the play is stopped
  for some other reason.

  * Fixed defect that would allow the penalty shootout kicker to kick
  the ball in the same cycle that it was caught by the goalie.

  * Fixed defect that would cause the server to go straight into
  penalty shootout mode when the half_time parameter was negative.

  * Fixed defect that would no include the goalies in the list of
  kickers in penalty shootouts.

  * Fixed defect that allowed goalies to move with the ball outside of
  the penalty area.  Now if the goalie moves or dashes while that ball
  is caught and moves the ball out of the penalty area, a catch fault
  is awarded and the ball placed on the closest edge of the penalty
  area, unless the goalie takes it over it's own goal line, in which
  case a goal or corner kick is awarded. The goalie is not moved
  unless it is within 9.15 meters of where the free kick is given.

  * Fixed defect in configuration file generation, where some values
  where written in their modified form (i.e. half_time was 3000
  instead of 300).

  * MySQLSaver will now create the tables it uses if they don't exist
  in the database.  This now means that there is very little setup
  required to start saving results to a MySQL database.  All you need
  to do is start mysqld and create a database for the results and
  grant access to that database.  For instance, something like

  mysql -u root

  mysql> create database `rcss`;
  mysql> grant all privileges on `rcss` to 'myuser';
  mysql> flush privileges;

  should do the trick.

  The start the server with the following options

  MySQLSaver::save=on
  MySQLSaver::db='rcss'
  MySQLSaver::user='myuser'

  and optionally

  MySQLSaver::round_name='the name of the round'
  MySQLSaver::event_name='the name of the event'

  or edit their defaults in ~/.rcssserver/MySQLSaver.conf

  * Fixed bug which caused MySQLSaver and StdOutSaver to always be
  disabled

  * Fixed bug in MySqlSaver in the formating of the time field.

  * Added time output to StdOutSaver.

  * Added CSVSaver.  This module saves the results to a file as comma
  seperated values.  It is turned off by default, but can be enabled
  with the CSVSaver::save option.  The default file is
  "rcssresults.csv", which can be changed with the
  CSVSaver::filename option.  If the file does not exist, it will be
  created.  If it does exist the data will be appended to the end of
  the file.  Each line contains the results for a game in the
  following format:

    TIME, TEAM_LEFT, TEAM_RIGHT, COACH_LEFT, COACH_RIGHT, SCORE_LEFT,
    SCORE_RIGHT, PEN_ATTEMPTS_LEFT, PEN_ATTEMPTS_RIGHT,
    PEN_SCORED_LEFT, PEN_SCORED_RIGHT, COIN_TOSS_WINNER

  Where:

   TIME is in the format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,
   TEAM_LEFT is the name of the left team in double quotes or NULL
   TEAM_RIGHT is the name of the right team in double quotes or NULL
   COACH_LEFT is the name of the left coach in double quotes or NULL
   COACH_RIGHT is the name of the right coach in double quotes or NULL
   SCORE_LEFT is the number or goals scored by the left team
   SCORE_RIGHT is the number or goals scored by the right team
   PEN_ATTEMPTS_LEFT is the number or penalties attempted by the left
   team or NULL
   PEN_ATTEMPTS_RIGHT is the number or penalties attempted by the right
   team or NULL
   PEN_SCORED_LEFT is the number or penalties scored by the left team
   or NULL
   PEN_SCORED_RIGHT is the number or penalties scored by the right
   team or NULL
   COIN_TOSS_WINNER is LEFT, RIGHT or NULL

  * Fixed problem in locating llimporter

  * The result savers are now loaded before the game.  This way any
  errors in parsing the configuration files or command line are seen
  before the game starts.

  * The MySQLSaver now has a few more parameters.  Please also note
  that the file parameter that was previously mentioned never
  existed.  Use the include parameter instead.  The saver now has a
  port parameter to specify what port should be used for the TCP
  connection.  There is also a unix_socket parameter, to specify the
  name of a socket or named pipe that should be used for the
  connection.  You can enable compression and ssl on the connection by
  using the compress and ssl parameters respectively. You can now
  specify the round_id that the game is part of.  If the round_id is
  not specified, round_name is used, along with the event_id or
  event_name parameters.  If the event_id is specified, then the
  event_name is ignored.

[9.4.2]
  * Fixed bug in build process that would complain that there was not
  target fot the -lrcsslibloader library

[9.4.1]
  * Fixed bugs in CLang that would cause crashed when using point
  arithmetic and comparison operations.

[9.4.0]
  * The server will now try to interprete ~ in filenames correctly on
  Windows platforms.  The code is untested and as such probably
  buggy.  Please provide as much information as possible when
  reporting bugs on this.

  * Added new server parameter option pen_coach_moves_players. When
  this value is set to true and one of the players of a team is not
  standing correctly at the end of the setup period in the penalty
  shootout, all players of this team are repositioned to a legal
  position. If during the penalty a player moves to a invalid
  position, it will be automatically move to the correct position.
  This means that with this option enabled, positional fouls are no
  longer possible during penalty shootouts.

  Do note that the player moved to the position to take the penalty
  shootout is the first of the players in the set of players that have
  not yet taken a shootout. This can thus be the goalkeeper and also
  does not have to be the player positioned closest to the ball.

  * Added a result saver that stores the results in a mysql database.
  This module will only be created if the mysql libraries can be found
  on your system.  This saver read configuration information from the
  command line arguments in the form of

  module::MySQLSaver::PARAM=VALUE

  where PARAM is a configuration parameter and VALUE is the value you
  want to set it to.  The following is the list of parameters
  understood by the MySQLSaver, their default values and a brief
  description:

  +-------+---------+---------------------------------------------+
  | Param | Default | Description                                 |
  +=======+=========+=============================================+
  | host  | ""      | The host name of IP of the machine running  |
  |       |         | the MySQL database.  An empty string        |
  |       |         | indicates that the localhost will be used.  |
  +-------+---------+---------------------------------------------+
  | user  | ""      | The username to use connecting to the       |
  |       |         | database.  The empty string indicates that  |
  |       |         | current unix username will be used          |
  +-------+---------+---------------------------------------------+
  | pass  | ""      | The database password for the user being    |
  |       |         | used.                                       |
  +-------+---------+---------------------------------------------+
  | db    | ""      | The name of the database to use.  An empty  |
  |       |         | string indicates that that default database |
  |       |         | will be used.                               |
  +-------+---------+---------------------------------------------+

  * Added a result saver that prints the results of the game to
  stdout in a human readable format.  You should not try to parse this
  with another program, as no guarantees about it's format are made,
  and it may change from version to version.  If you wish to get text
  results in a parsable format, please create your own module for
  doing so.

  * Added support for saving game results via dynamically loaded
  modules (see below for information about modules).  A result saver
  must inherit from rcss::ResultSaver and on initialisation of the
  module, it must register with rcss::ResultSaver::Factory factory.
  An example of how this is done can be seen in stdoutsaver.cpp.

  * Integrated the new configuration parser in rcssbase. The old
  configuration file format is no longer supported, but can be
  easily converted to the new format using the following awk script.

    awk '/^[ \\t]*$/ {} \
    /^[^#]+[:]/ { gsub(/:/, \"=\" ); $1 = \"server::\" $1; } \
    /^[ \\t]*[^#:=]+$/ { $1 = \"server::\" $1 \" = true\"; } \
    { print; }' \
    oldserver.conf > newserver.conf

  The server uses this technique to read ~/.rcssserver-server.conf if
  it exists and ~/.rcssserver/server.conf (the new conf file) does not
  and then save the configuration to ~/.rcssserver/server.conf.  This
  means that most users will be unaffected by the configuration file
  changes and ~/.rcssserver/server.conf will be created with all their
  current options.

  A similar procedure is used for ~/.rcssserver-player.conf and can
  be used for other player.conf files.

  You will also need to modify any scripts you have that pass
  parameters to rcssserver, by replacing -PARAM VALUE with either
  server::PARAM = VALUE or player::PARAM = VALUE and -sfile FILE and
  -pfile FILE with include = FILE.

  * Added support for automatic module loading.  Modules can be added
  or removed by adding them to the module directory (default is
  /usr/local/share/rcssserver/modules) which can be specified with
  the module_dir server parameter.  On systems where dynamic loading
  is not supported, or static compilation is used, module loading can
  be simulated by using the RCSSSERVER_DLOPEN_LIBS option during
  configure.

  Custom modules must contain the following line

  LIBLOADER_EXPORT( libname, init, fin );

  Where libname is the name of the library without the file extention
  (e.g libstdoutsaver) and init and fin are the names of
  initialisation and finalisation functions for the module.  These
  functions must take not parameters and must return void.

  Your module must also register (and deregister) it's class(es) with
  an object factory (this is usually done in the initialisation and
  finalisation functions), which is used in the server to create
  instances of the class.  Please see the base class's object factory
  interface for more details.

  * Added support for coach names in the log file names.  The online
  init command now has the following format:

  (init TEAMNAME [COACHNAME] [(version X)])

  e.g.

  (init myteam (version 7))
  (init myteam mycoach)
  (init myteam mycoach (version 6))

  are all valid online coach init string.

  At the end of the game, the logfiles are renamed and if the online
  coach specifies a coachname when it connects, then _COACHNAME is
  added after the team name.

  e.g.

  200305081101-test_coach_1-vs-test2_coach2_2.rcl

  is an example of a log file for 'team' vs 'team2', where 'team' had
  an online coach called 'coach' and 'team2' had an online coach
  called 'coach2'.

  * Fixed a defect where pointing players were sent twice in a see
  message.

[9.3.7]
  * Fixed defect in the sending of team graphics to monitors where the
  first line of the data was repeated and there was no space between
  team_graphic_{l|r} and(.  Thanks got to Matus Horvath for reporting
  the problem and providing the patch.

  * Fixed gcc3.3 compilation problem.

[9.3.6]
  * Fixed defect that caused a segmentation fault when a player
  reconnected.

[9.3.5]
  * Fixed bug in the handling of ear on/off commands sent by players,
  where partial and complete where inverted.

  * To help with future user problems, the server now also outputs at
  startup the version of rcssbase being used.

  * Fixed catch_fault_r string which was perviously cacth_fault_r.

  * Fixed online coach releated seg fault.  This may have been caused
  if a coach tryed to connect after a coach had already connected and
  disconnected for the same team.

  * A bug was fixed that was causing nested conditions in CLang to be
  restructured in logically incorrect way.

[9.3.4]
  * The default values for tackle_dist and tackle_width have been
  changed to 2.0 and 1.0 respectively.  You will either need to change
  these manually in your ~/.rcssserver-server.conf remove your
  ~/.rcssserver-server.conf to have the defaults regenerated.

  * Added constraint such that substitutions are not allowed after
  the normal and extra halfs have passed. It is thus not possible
  anymore to make substitutions during or just before the penalty
  shootouts.

[9.3.3]
  * The rcsoccersim script will now report errors if the server or a
  monitor cannot be found.  The script has also been modifed to use
  the monitor specified by the RCSSMONITOR enviroment variable as the
  default monitor (this can be handy of you use your own monitor or
  wish to change the default to the classic monitor).  If RCSSMONITOR
  is not set, the script will try to use either rcssmonitor or failing
  that, rcssmonitor_classic.  At anytime you can override the default
  by using the -frameview and -classic options.

  * Fixed bug where recover_init was sent to v8 players when it
  shouldn't have been.

  * Some build problems on OS X have now been fixed.  The server seams
  to work on OS X, if built statically.  For dynamic libs to work you
  will at the very least need to rebuild the libtool and auto*
  components by running

  aclocal
  glibtoolize --force --copy
  aclocal
  autoheader
  automake --add-missing --copy
  autoconf

  from the rcssserver directory.  There may be other problems that I
  am unaware of.

[9.3.2]
  * RCSSClient can now be compiled without ncurses on systems that do
  have ncurses, by using the '--without-ncurses' parameter to configure.

  * The SED environment variable is now set automatically in the
  libtool script, during configure.

  * Fixed crash during initialization of default server paramters on
  Solaris platforms

  * RCSServer now will compile with either sstream or strstream,
    depending on which is available.

[9.3.0]
  * Fixed bug in synch mode that would cause the server to send
  "think" commands to disconnected clients and wait for a response
  from them.

  * Fixed bug in flex usage that would require manual editing of the
  generated source files on some systems.  This bugs would only affect
  people who are checking out the code from CVS, those editing the .ll
  files or those rebuilding the generated code for other reasons.

  * Fixed bug in synch mode that would result in a server crash when
  clients disconnect.

  * Fixed bug that allowed kicks and tackles after the end of the match.

  * Fixed bug where the effort_init server parameter was not set, not used,
  but sent to players as part of the server param message.

  * Fixed bug where the recover_init server parameter was not set, not used,
  but sent to players as part of the server param message.

  * Added automatic penalty mode.

  First of all two different server parameters have been added that specify
  how many halfs are played:
  nr_normal_halfs (default=2) - number of halfs that are always fully played
  nr_max_extra_halfs          - number of extra halfs when score is a draw
                                golden goal rule applies in these halfs

  If no goals are scored and the server parameter penalty_shootouts is true,
  the automatic penalty mode is started.

  New play modes, messages and server parameters have been introduced:

  New PlayModes:
  PM_PenaltySetup_Left/Right (message: penalty_setup_l/r)
  PM_PenaltyReady_Left/Right (message: penalty_ready_l/r)
  PM_PenaltyTaken_Left/Right (message: penalty_taken_l/r)
  PM_PenaltyMiss_Left/Right  (message: penalty_miss_l/r)
  PM_PenaltyScore_Left/Right (message: penalty_score_l/r)

  Messages:
  penalty_onfield_l/r
  penalty_foul_l/r
  penalty_winner_l/r
  penalty_draw

  Server parameters
  pen_before_setup_wait
  pen_setup_wait
  pen_ready_wait
  pen_taken_wait
  pen_nr_kicks
  pen_max_extra_kicks
  pen_dist_x
  pen_max_goalie_dist_x
  pen_allow_mult_kicks
  pen_random_winner

  The procedure is as follows

  1. The referee announces on which side the penalties will be taken using
     the message (penalty_onfield_l/r).

  2. The ref moves the ball to the penalty mark, which is on a distance of
     pen_dist_x from the goal.

  3. The ref chooses a team to start at random and announces it
    (penalty_setup_l/r).

  4. The referee then waits pen_setup_wait cycles and then checks whether the
     players are moved according to the following rules:
     - the defending goalie must move to within goalie_pen_line_dist meter of
       the goal line and between the posts
     - the other goalie must move behind the goal line and outside the penalty
       area line (the only exception is when the goalie takes the penalty)
     - the defending players and the teammates of the player must move
       within the center circle.
     - one of the players of the team that takes the penalty has to move within
       2 meters of the position of the ball. One player is not allowed to be
       the penalty taker again before all eleven players (including the goalie!)
       have taken a penalty.
     If after pen_setup_wait cycles one or both teams do not obey the above
     rules the penalty is over. In case the attacking team makes a mistake, it
     is counted as a miss, otherwise as a score.
     If both teams obey the rules, the mode changes to
     PM_PenaltyReady_Left/Right

  5. The attacker then has pen_ready_wait cycles to take the first kick.
     If one of the rules of 4 is not obeyed during these cycles or the time has
     elapsed, the penalty is over and is counted as a foul for that team.
     After this first kick, the play mode changes to
     PM_PenaltyTaken_Left/Right..

  6. Depending on the server paramater pen_allow_mult_kicks the attacker is
     now allowed to kick the ball again or not. When the ball is catched or
     passed the goalline within pen_taken_wait cycles, it is either called a
     miss or a score (depending where the ball crossed the goalline)
     immediately.
     When pen_taken_wait cycles have elapsed without a catch or the ball passing
     the goalline, it is also called a miss. In case of a miss the play mode
     changes to  PM_PenaltyMiss_Left/Right, otherwise to
     PM_PenaltyScore_Left/Right.

  7. Now it is checked whether one of the teams has won.
     One of the two teams has won when.
     - pen_nr_kicks penalties have been played and one team has scored more
       goals than the other
     - less than pen_nr_kicks have been played but one of the teams can never
       get to the score of the other team within pen_nr_kicks
     - it was a draw after pen_nr_kicks but after an even number of extra
       penalties sessions (less than pen_max_extra_kicks) one team has scored
       more goals
     In the case of a win the message pen_winner_l/r is communicated and the
     playmode changes to PM_TimeOver.
     Otherwise when pen_nr_kicks + pen_max_extra_kicks have been played, the
     game is a draw. Depending on the parameter pen_random_winner the server
     picks a random winner or not. In the latter case the message pen_draw is
     communicated.
     In all other situations, and no team has won yet, the referee goes back to
     2 after pen_before_setup_wait cycles.

  *  Changed file format of log files and game logs because of possible
     automated penalties after a match. The new format is as follows:

     {date}-{team_l_info}-vs-{team_r_info}.rc[gl]

     where {team_[lr]_info} looks as follows:
      {team}_{score}[_{pen_score}[w]]

     with
      team:      name of the team
      score:     goals scored by this team (excluding penalty goals)
      pen_score: scored penalty of this team (optional)
      w:         optional winner indication when penalties were also a draw
                 and this team was the random winner (pen_random_winner: on)

     Possible examples are
     - normal game without penalties
         200303180158-MRB2003_1-vs-UvA_Trilearn_2.rg
     - with penalties
         200303180158-MRB2003_1_4-vs-UvA_Trilearn_1_5.rg
     - with penalties, pen_nr_kicks + pen_max_extra_kicks didn't bring a
       winner and no winner was picked randomly (pen_random_winnner: off)
         200303180158-MRB2003_1_7-vs-UvA_Trilearn_1_7.rg
     - penalties was also a draw and winner (Trilearn) was picked randomly
         200303180158-MRB2003_1_4-vs-UvA_Trilearn_1_4w.rg

[9.2.4]
  * Fixed defect that would incorrectly award an indirect free kick to
  the right team after a catch fault by the right team.  An indirect
  free kick to the left team is now awarded.

  * Fixed defect that would cause compilation to fail with gcc3.2

[9.2.3]
  * Fixed defect where the server would not send version 9 parameters
  to version 9 coaches.

[9.2.2]
  * Fixed defect where the server would send "(ok move)" to the offline
  coach after it issued a move command, even if there was no such
  object that could be moved.  Now the server sends
  "(error illegal_object_form)".

  * Clients can now connect specifying version 9 as the protocol
  version.  This simply adds support for the new server parameters
  that have been introduced.

[9.2.1]
  * Offsides are now no longer possible from a kick-in, goal-kick or
  corner-kick.  This is in compliance with FIFA regualtions.

  * A new limitation has been added to the random player types (hetero
  players) which prevents players from having a maximum speed above
  the default player and consume less stamina at maximum speed than
  the default player.

[9.2.0]
  * Configuration now fails if the SED environment variable is not
  set.  Libtool needs this to be set to function correctly

  * Goal posts have now been added.  They are circular with a radius
  of 6cm and they are located at:

  x = +- (FIELD_LENGTH*0.5 - 6cm)
  y = +- (GOAL_WIDTH*0.5 + 6cm)

  The goal posts have different collision dynamics than other
  objects. An object collides with a post if it's path gets within
  object.size + 6cm of the center of the post.  An object that
  collides with the post bounces off elastically.

  * The dynamics of the goalie catch have now changed.  If the goalie
  successfully catches a ball it is moved adjacent to and facing the
  ball and both the goalie and ball have their velocities set to
  zero.  When the goalie moves, dashes or turns while the ball is
  caught, the ball remains adjacent to and directly in front of the
  goalie.

  * The goalie can now issue catch commands at any location.  If the
  catch is successful, and the ball is outside of the penalty area or
  if the goalie moves the ball outside of the penalty area and it's
  still in the field, an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing
  team at the ball's current location. If a caught ball is moved over
  the goal line but not inside the goal, a corner kick is awarded.  If
  a caught ball is moved into the goal, a goal is awarded.

  * Checking for goals, out of bounds and within penalty area no
  complies with FIFA regulations.  For a goal to be scored the ball
  must be totally within the goal - i.e.

  |ball.x| > FIELD_LENGTH*0.5 + ball_radius

  Similarly the ball must be completely out of the pitch before it is
  considered out - i.e

  |ball.x| > FIELD_LENGTH*0.5 + ball_radius ||
  |ball.y| > FIELD_WIDTH*0.5 + ball_radius

  Lastly the ball is within the penalty area (and thus catchable) if
  the ball is at least partially within the penalty area - i.e.

  |ball.y| <= PENALTY_WIDTH*0.5 + ball_radius &&
  |ball.x| <= FIELD_LENGTH*0.5 + ball_radius &&
  |ball.x| >= FIELD_LENGTH*0.5 - (PENALTY_LENGTH*0.5 + ball_radius)

[9.1.5]
  * Fixed bug in static compilation

  * Fixed crash on win32 systems where the USER environment variable
    has not been set.  The server now reports and error and exits if
    the USER variable is needed (most commonly for locating the config
    files) but not available.

[9.1.4]
  * Fixed compilation problems introduced by libtools 1.4.3 on
  platforms where the SED environment variable is not set.

  * Fixed compilation bug on some platformsm due to an invalid
  preprocessor directive

[9.1.3]
  * Fixed bug which would cause terminiation of the server due to
  problems with audio messages and the associated random number generator.

[9.1.2]
  * Fixed bug in configuration that would prevent the detection of
  certain libraries when rcssserver is configured before rcssbase is built.

[9.1.1]
  * Fixed compilation problem on some platforms due to
  incompatibilities between gcc3.2 and inttypes.h

  * Fixed bug in static compilation when rcssbase has not yet been
  installed.

[9.1.0]
  * The server now supports a new game: Keepaway.  In this game, the
  left team (the "keepers") attempt to keep the ball away from the right
  team (the "takers").  An episode ends when the takers capture the ball
  or the ball leaves the rectangular play region.  When this happens,
  the referee sends a message "training Keepaway 1" to the players
  indicating that the episode has ended.

  In Keepaway mode, the simulator logs episode data to a ".kwy" file.
  This log file records the episode start/end times, the episode
  duration, and the condition under which the episode ended.

  To play Keepaway, turn on the 'keepaway' parameter.  You can specify
  the number of players on each team and the size of the play region
  using additional parameters.  A full list of options can be found in
  the "rcssserver-server.conf" file.

  When using this feature, it is strongly recommended that you turn
  off the offside rule.  Also, it is recommended that you set the
  halftime to -1.  To start the server in Keepaway mode using the
  default options:
  rcssserver -keepaway on -use_offside off -half_time -1

  Also see the 'm_keepaway' parameter of the monitor to use the
  Keepaway field layout.

  Details of the Keepaway task as well as some sample experiments can
  be found in the following article available from
  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/papers.html.

  @Incollection(StoneSutton2001,
        Author="Peter Stone and Richard S. Sutton",
        Title="Keepaway Soccer:  a Machine Learning Testbed",
        booktitle= "{R}obo{C}up-2001: Robot Soccer World Cup {V}",
        Editor="Andreas Birk and Silvia Coradeschi and Satoshi Tadokoro",
        Publisher="Springer Verlag",address="Berlin",year="2002")

  Support for Keepaway in the rcssserver and rcssmonitor was
  implemented by Greg Kuhlmann.

  * The server now supports dlopening libraries.  The intention is to
  allow dlopening of players at some stage, but to test the concept,
  the timers are now dlopened on platforms that support it.  This also
  means that if you specify a prefix to configure, you *must* not use
  relative directories, otherwise the server won't be able to find the
  libraries.  To disable dlopening use the --disable-shared flag to
  configure.

  * Fixed incorrect back pass detection when a player tackles the
  ball.

  * Fixed incorrect back pass detection when players from both teams
  kick or tackle the ball

  * Fixed incorrect initialisation of kick_off_wait and connect_wait
  parameters which are used for automatic mode.

  * Visuals have been re-written (again), this time using the
  sender-serializer design which was initially used with audio
  messages.  While making the code a lot simpler and easier to
  maintain, it also resulted in significant performance
  improvements. On my machine, the average time taken to produce
  visuals as decreased by 12.5% and the maximum time taken to produce
  a visual has reduced by 80% (possibly an outlier).

  * The server now will wait till the left team has connected at least
  one player before starting the right team.  This only applies when
  using the team_*_start configuration options.  If the team on the
  left does not connect, the right team will not be started.

  * Fixed installation problem with machines that don't have flex.

  * The compression commands now accept -1 to indicate that zlib is
  not to be used (default) and 0 to 9 indicate levels of compression
  as per the zlib library.

[9.0.4]
  * The server.conf file now supports tilde expantion for other users
  (i.e.  ~foobar expands the the home directory of user foobar).
  Thaks go to Marc Butler for providing the patch.

  * RCSSClient now uses the new streaming sockets in rcssbase and is
  multithreaded.  The client no longer accepts the -e option, instead
  simply cat the script file and pipe it to the client.

  * RCSSClient now uses ncurses when it's available to seperate the
  input and output, this can be disabled ( like when you want to
  redirect the output to a file ) by using the -nogui option.

  * RCSSClient's command line argument parseing has changed. Now the
  server and port are specified with '-server SERVER' and '-port PORT'

[9.0.3]
  * Fixed errors in default server.conf generation.  Thanks go to
  Michael Gollin for providing the fix.

[9.0.2]
  * The server can now be run automatically.  When 'auto_mode' is on
  the server will wait 'connect_wait' cycles for the players to
  connect and 'kick_off_wait' cycles before kicking off.  At the end
  of the two halves, the server will wait 'game_over_wait' cycles
  before exiting.  It will not continue into extra time.

  * String command line and .conf parameters may now be enclosed in
    quotes.

  * Two new parameters have been added, 'team_l_start' and
  'team_r_start' that can be used to specify a command to run to start
  the left and right team respectively.  If the command contains a
  space make sure you enclose the entire command in double quotes.

  For instance, to start the left team on 'team_host', connecting to a
  server on 'server_host', one could use something like

  rcssserver -team_l_start "ssh team_host \"~/startMyTeam server_host\""

  or add

  team_l_start : "ssh another_host "~/startMyTeam some_host""

  to the '~/.rcssserver-server.conf' file

[9.0.1]
  * The automatic output of CLang messages as full hear messages has
  been disabled due to problems with output during games.

[9.0.0]
  * CLang messages will now output as

  (hear TIME_SENT online_coach_{left|right} TIME_RECV (message))

  if the side and time recv have been set, otherwise they are output
  as normal.  This is only intended as a convenience feature for
  clients so that they can compare the output of the parsed message
  with the actual message parsed.

  * rcss::clang::Parser now inherits from the new rcss::Parser, found
  in rcssbase/parser.h

  * The CLang lexer is now reentrant, and can only be rebuilt using
    flex.

  * The order in which the search for the rcssbase files is performed
  has changed.  If the "rcssbase" environment variable is set, then it
  will first look in the path specified by "rcssbase".  Next it will
  try to look into rcssbase directly, by assuming rcssserver and
  rcssbase are being installed as part of the larger rcsoccersim
  package.  Failing that it will then search for the headers as it
  would for any other header file.

  [rel_10]
  * Fixed defect where a back passes is detected when the goalie sends
   a catch but the ball is too far away.

  [rel_9]
  * To save on compile time and space, debuging infomration is now
  disabled by default.  Use `./configure CXXFLASG="<YOUR FLAGS>"' to
  overide the new defualt of "-O2".

  * Shared libraries are no longer built by default.  If you want to
  use shared libraries you will need to specify --enable-shared at
  configure time.

  [rel_8]
  * Fixed egcs 2.91.66 compilation problems

  [rel_7]
  * Fixed minor defect which would reverse the order of points in
  CLang Quad, Tri and Rec regions.

  * Fixed defect where quotes where missing from CLang define messages.

  * Fixed defect that would send CLang messages that required support
  for both CLang 7 and CLang 8 to clients that supported only one of
  CLang 7 or CLang 8.

  * Disabled by default the sending of (hear time TEAM [UNUM])
    messages.

  * The type audio messages received by a player can now be enabled
  and disabled via the ear command in the form

  (ear ({on|off} [TEAM] [TYPE]))

  TEAM is "our", "opp", "left", "l", "right", "r" or the team name of
  a team.  If TEAM is omitted, the message will apply to messages from
  both teams.  TYPE is used to specify the type of audio, where
  "complete" or "c" is used to specify messages which contain the
  audio data and "partial" or "p" is used to specify messages which do
  not contain audio data.  If TYPE is not specified, the message will
  apply to both types.

  For example:

  '(ear (on))' enables all audio.
  '(ear (off partial))' disables '(hear time TEAM [UNUM])' messages.
  '(ear (on our complete))' enables '(hear time TEAM [UNUM] "message")'
  messages from the players team mates.
  '(ear (off opp))' disables all audio from opponent players.

  * Fixed compilation problem on GCC 2.96

  * Added support for queueing of CLang RuleMsgs and DelMsgs.  The
  number of these types of messages that can be sent each CLang
  windows is specifed by two new parameters, 'clang_rule_win' and
  'clang_del_win', both of whcih have defaults of 1.

  * Fixed bug with proper goal kicks which would award a goal kick to
  the opposition it a opposing team member kicked the ball when the
  play mode was still goal kick.  Instead the goal kick is retaken.

  * Fixed some problems when compiling on Cygwin

  * Fixed bug that would allow a player to kick the ball if the goalie
  had caught the ball and move on top of the player.

  * Defualt for the offide area is now 2.5

  * Proper goal kicks (aka LAW 16) is now off by default.

  * Fixed rcssclient compilation problem when libz is not detected on
  the system.

  * Replay parameter in no longer available.  This was for some pretty
  old code to replay the games.  This is done by rcsslogplayer instead
  (and has been for a long while).

  * Corrected an old defect that would allow players to dash in before
  kick off and have the acceleration accumulate until the kick off.
  Thanks go to Michael Gollin for reporting this bug and how to
  correct it.

  [rel_6]
  * The team graphic protocol has been changed to make it easier to
  detect and recover from lost messages.  The new format requires the
  256x64 image to be broken up into 8x8 tiles (to make sure it will
  fit into the message to the monitors) and has the form

  (team_graphic (<X> <Y> "<XPM line>" ... "<XPM line>"))

  Where X and Y are the co-ordinates of the 8x8 tile in the complete
  256x64 image, starting at 0 and ranging upto 31 and 7 respectively.
  Each XPM line is a line from the 8x8 xpm tile.

  The server responds with

  (ok team_graphic <X> <Y>)

  The server then sends

  (team_graphic_{l|r} (<X> <Y> "<XPM line>" ... "<XPM line>"))

  to each monitor via the message board.

  * Fixed defaut values for new parameters in server.conf.

  * Fixed defect which would not allow online coaches to substitute a
  player for the same player type if there was already the maximum of
  that player type on the field.

  * Tackle power is no longer reduced by the probablility of the
    tackle.

  * Substitutions are now explicitly recorded in the log-files. The
  message board is now used to record player substitutions in the game
  log and send the data to the monitors in the form

  (change_player_type {l|r} <unum> <player_type>)

  * Fixed problem parsing parameters when compiled with gcc 3.x

  [rel_5]
  * Parameters have been added to enable and disable free kick faults
  and back passes.  They are

  free_kick_faults back_passes

  and they are both enabled by default.

  * Parameters have been added for the enforcement of proper goal
  kicks.  They are

  proper_goal_kicks stopped_ball_vel max_goal_kicks

  and they have default values of on, 0.01 and 3 respectively.

  * The server will now allow online coaches to send team_graphic
  commands before kick off.  The graphic must be a 256 x 64 XPM and
  each team_graphic command must contain just one line of the XPM.
  The command has the form

  (team_graphic "<line>")

  and the server will respond with

  (ok team_graphic)

  for each line and

  (ok team_graphic_done)

  when the image is complete.

  As each line is received it is sent to the monitors on the message
  board in the form

  team_graphic_{l|r} "<line>"

  At this stage the monitor must be connected at the time the lines
  are sent.

	* Fixed defect which dereferenced Stadium::M_caught_ball when
      NULL.

  * Fixed defect in kick faults where a kick fault was not called if
  the player taking the free kick, kicked the ball multiple times
  before dashing and then kicking.

  * Fixed defect in server params where visible_angle was reported in
  radians instead of degrees.

  * Corrected defect where the ball going out of bounds from a goal
  kick would result in a drop ball on the side line.

  [rel_4]
  * Server param messages now contain tackle parameters of version 8+
  clients.  The way the message is generated now means that the order
  of items has changed and derived values are not sent.  All string
  values are now quoted to ease paring should they contain brakets.

  * Fixed defect where collisions were modelled between the goalie and
  the ball when the ball was caught by the goalie.

  * The it is now required that the ball is kicked directly into play
  from the goal kick in compliance with FIFA law 16.  If the ball
  stops or another player kicks the ball before it leaves the penalty
  area, the kick is re-taken. If the player taking the goal kick
  cannot manage to kick the ball directly into play after 3 attempts,
  a free kick is awarded to the opposing team in the nearest penalty
  corner.  IMO the player should also receive a yellow card for
  incompetence and time wasting, but we don't have yellow cards yet.

  * Added a tackle_power_rate(0.027), which was previously missing and
  resulted in all but the smallest of tackles producing a maximum ball
  speed.  The effective power is now reduced by the probability of the
  tackle succeeding.  This is done by simply multiplying the
  probability of success with power requested.

  * Fixed defect that allowed players to kick and tackle after a free
  kick or back pass infringement but before the free kick was awarded.

  * Fixed defect that allowed players to be close to the ball during
  an opponents free kick.

  * Fixed 1 cycle delay in play mode change after a free kick was
    taken.

  * Removed audio debugging messages

  * Fixed defect in backpasses where a kick from a player on team A
  followed by a freekick and a catch by the goalie would be
  incorrectly called a back pass.

	* Fixed bug in the reported pointto directions.  Previously they
  were incorrectly adjusted by the players orientation.  Thanks to
  Michael Gollin for pointing out the bug and providing the
  correction.

  * Fixed bug in the bracket counting of quoted say messages.
  Messages such as (say "Test)") are now parsed correctly.

  * Fixed bug in new Vectors that are uses in pointto.  The setHead()
  method would transpose the X and Y coordinates.  Thanks to Michael
  Gollin for pointing out the bug and providing the correction.

  [rel_3]
  * Added rules to CLang.  Clients can now define rules, which can be
  turned on and off and deleted later on.  Rules are can be defined as
  follows

  (define DEFS)

  DEFS : // same as old defs
       | (definerule VAR {model|direc} RULE)

  VAR : [abe-oqrt-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*

  RULE : (CONDITION DIRECTIVE_LIST)
       | (CONDITION RULE_LIST)
       | ID_LIST

  RULE_LIST : RULE_LIST RULE | RULE

  ID_LIST : all | VAR | (ID_LIST2)

  ID_LIST2 : ID_LIST2 VAR | VAR

  CONDITION :  // unchanged

  DIRECTIVE_LIST : // unchanged

  For example the following messages are valid

  (define (definerule MyRule12345 model ((true) "dostuff")))
  (define (definerule MyRule2 direc ((true) "doStuff" "andOtherStuff")))
  (define (definerule MyRule3 model ((true) "dostuff"))
          (definerule MyRule3 model ((true) "doStuff" "andOtherStuff")))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc MyRule2))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc (MyRule2 MyRule3)))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc ((true) MyRule2)))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc ((true) (MyRule2 MyRule3))))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc all))
  (define (definerule MyRule4 direc ((true) all)))

  Rules may be deleted at a later date by using the delete message, which has
  the form

  (delete IDLIST)

  For example the following messages are valid

  (delete all)
  (delete MyRule12345)
  (delete (foo bar))

  Rules are then activated or deactivate using a rule message, which has the
  form

  (rule ACTIVATION_LIST)

  ACTIVATION_LIST : ACTIVATION_LIST ACTIVATION_ELEM | ACTIVATION_ELEM

  ACTIVATION_ELEM : ({on|off} ID_LIST)

  For example the following message is valid

  (rule (off all) (on (foo bar)) (off MyRule12345))

  Each activation element should be applied in the order it is listed.  For the
  above example, all the rules should be turned off, then the rules 'foo'
  and 'bar' should be turned on and finally 'MyRule12345' should be turned off.

  [rel_2]
  * Added new trade-off between dash_power_rate and stamina_inc_max. The
  old trade-offs between dash_power_rate vs. player_size and
  stamina_inc_max vs. player_speed_max are switched off now by
  default. V8 clients get additional info regarding the new trade-off.
  player_speed_max is 1.2 now for all player types by default.

  * Players kicking the ball to themselves after a free kick is no longer
  allowed.  Players may kick the ball several times so long as they do not dash
  in between any of the kicks.  Once another player kicks the ball, the free
  kick taker may proceed to the ball as normal.  If a player does kick the ball
  to themselves after a free kick, a free kick is awarded to the opposing team
  at the point that the second kick occurred.  When this occurs the play mode
  changes to free_kick_fault_[lr], where the l or r is the side of the
  offending player.  After AFTER_FREE_KICK_FAULT_WAIT(30) cycles the playmode
  changes to free_kick_[lr], where l or r is the opposite side of the offending
  player.

  * Fixed bug in the setting of the team side of a ball owner condition in
  CLang.

  * Back passes are no longer allowed.  The server defines a back pass as when
  a player kicks the ball and it is caught by the goalie of the same team,
  without interference of a player from the other team.  If a back pass does
  occur, a free kick is awarded to the other teams in the closest corner of
  the penalty box. When this occurs the play mode changes to back_pass_[lr],
  where the l or r is the side of the offending goalie.  After
  AFTER_BACK_PASS_WAIT(30) cycles the playmode changes to free_kick_[lr],
  where l or r is the opposite side of the offending goalie.
  A pass from a player on team X bouncing of team Y player and then being
  caught by to team X goalie is *not* a back pass. A pass from a player on
  team X bouncing of an team Y player and then being caught by the team Y
  goalie is *not* a back pass.

  * Audio from players now has the form

  (hear time direction TEAM [UNUM] "message")
  (hear time TEAM [UNUM])

  where TEAM is

  opp | our

  and the uniform number is only given for the player's own team (to simulate
  recognition of team-mates' voices).

  The first format is for the first message from each team in each cycle,
  all other messages received that cycle have the second format.

  * Players can now send say messages with the message enclosed in quotes.
  For instance

  (say "message")

  It has the same effect as

  (say message)

  The only difference is that the later version must be followed by a null,
  whereas the new version may be followed by other commands.  For instance

  (say "message")(dash 100)

  would be interpreted by the server as a say and a dash command, but

  (say message)(dash 100)

  would be interpreted as a single say message only, and the data being said as
  "message)(dash 100)"

  * Fixed a line ordering problem experienced by old clients.  Some of these
  clients rely on the order in which lines are presented (nearest first), so
  now the server sorts lines into nearest first for pre v8 clients. V8 and
  clients should not rely on the order of any of components of messages sent.
  BTW code I wrote for clients I was working on exhibits this reliance on
  ordering :)=

  * Added support for CLang Freeform messages during certain times during
  playon.  Coaches can send Freeform messages for freeform_send_period cycles
  after every freeform_wait_period cycles.  Default values for
  freeform_send_period and freeform_wait_period are 20 and 600 respectively.
  For example, if the playmode changes to playon at cycle 420 and stays in
  playon till the end of this example, the coaches can send freeform messages
  between 1020 and 1040, 1620 and 1640, etc.

  [rel_1]
  * The CLang lib has changed and is not compatible with the previous version.
  To reflect this the library version has changed from 0.0.0 to 1.0.0.  Some of
  the classes still need a little work before I would say they are fully usable
  in client code, but what is already there should make it a lot easier than
  starting from scratch.  Just remember that the entire simulator is under
  LGPL (except for rcssmonitor which is under GPL), so if you do use modified
  server code in you clients, you *must* release these modifications when you
  release your binary. Earlier and more frequent releases would be more than
  welcome.  Hopefully this way we can start some sort of Standard RoboCup
  Library (SRCLib).

  * Added support for arithmetic on points within CLang messages.  Points can
  now have the form

  (<POINT_LIST>)

  where POINT_LIST is

  <POINT_LIST> <ARITH_OP> <POINT_LIST> | <POINT>

  where ARITH_OP is

  + | - | * | /

  Normal operator precedence and bracket usage applies. As an example the
  following is the point halfway between the ball and the opponent player 5.

  (((pt ball) + (pt opp 5)) / (pt 2 2))

  The clients should interprete all point arithmetic operations are applied to
  the X and Y co-ordinate independently.  For instance,

  ((pt A B) ? (pt C D))

  where ? is one of the operators, should be interpreted as

  (pt A?B C?D)

  * Added support for triangular and rectangular regions in CLang.  They have
  the form

  (tri <point> <point> <point>)
  (rec <point> <point>)

  * Added support for multiple actions in directives.  Players should treat
  directives with multiple actions in the same manner as if each action was
  sent as part of an individual directive.  The grammar for the new directives
  is

  ({do|dont} {our|opp} <UNUM_SET> <ACTION_LIST>)

  * Added ActPassReg, ActPassUNum, ActDribble, ActClear, ActShoot, ActHold,
  ActIntercept and ActTackle to CLang, which have the form

  (pass <REGION>)
  (pass <UNUM_SET>)
  (dribble <REGION>)
  (clear <REGION>)
  (shoot)
  (hold)
  (intercept)
  (tackle <UNUM_SET>)

  * Added CondUNum messages to the CLang, which has the form

  (unum <VAR> <UNUM_SET>)

  This allows coaches to limit the set of uniform numbers that can match a
  variable, such as

  (info ( 9000 (and (bowner opp {X})(unum X {1 3 5})) (do our {5} (mark {X}))))

  * Added Player var messages to CLang, which allows messages similar to

  (info ( 9000 (bowner opp {X}) (do our {5} (mark {X}))))

  Players should evaluate the above message for X set to 1 ~ 11.  For instance
  if the current ball owner happens to be the opponent player 3, the player 5
  should mark opponent 3.

  The variables may be quoted can have the form

  [abe-oqrt-z]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*

  or

  \"[0-9A-Za-z\(\)\.\+\-\*\/\?\<\>\_ ]+\"

  The format for unquoted variables may look a bit strange.  This is because
  the character p, d, c, and s can not be used to begin an unquoted variable as
  they are ball move tokens.

  Quoted variables do *not* equal unquoted variables -- i.e X is not the same
  as "X".

  * Added comparison messages to CLang. They have the form

  (time <COMP> <INT>)
  (opp_goals <COMP> <INT>)
  (own_goals <COMP> <INT>)
  (goal_diff <COMP> <INT>)
  (<INT> <COMP> time)
  (<INT> <COMP> opp_goals)
  (<INT> <COMP> our_goals)
  (<INT> <COMP> goal_diff)

  Where COMP is <, <=, ==, !=, >= or > and INT is some integer value that you
  are comparing the current time, or goals to.  Players should evaluate
  comparisons to true is the *current time* or *current goals* compared to the
  int is true.  The players should *not* take the time or goals to mean the
  time the command  was sent or the time the command was received.

  [rel_5]
  * Fixed bug on some platforms in which no data is ever written to rcg files

  * Fixed bug in serialisation on 'clang ver' messages to clients

  * Fixed seg fault when players send 'clang ver' messages before the coach
	has connected.

  * Fixed bug in minimum recovery fix.

  * Added missing ')' to 'ok clang' message.

  [rel_4]
  * Fixed bug in which CLang messages were not sent to players because the side
  in the CLang message was not set correctly

  * Fixed bug that allowed minimum recovery to fall below recovery_min.

  * Added support for full-state messages when server is in synch mode.
  Thank you to Michael Gollin for pointing out the problem and the code
  for fixing it.

  * Fixed bug in automatic generation of server.conf for Tackle parameters

  * Logs are now flush manually to prevent log delays when they build up and
  flush manually

  * Fixed bug for reconnecting clients

  [rel_3]
  * Fixed compilation problems experienced on some machines.

  [rel_1]
  * The server now requires all players that support the Coach Language to
  explicitly advise the server, through the following command

  (clang (ver <MIN> <MAX>))

  Where MIN and MAX are unsigned ints indicating the minimum and maximum
  version numbers supported by the player.  Min must be less than or equal to
  max. If no such command is received by the server, it assumes that no CLang
  is supported.  When players hear an unsupported CLang message the get the
  following

  (hear <TIME> online_coach_{left|right} (unsupported_clang))

  instead of the actual clang message sent.  This means that previous clients
  need to be modified to be supported, they should send the following:

  (clang (ver 7 7))

  * Version 8 and above Online Coaches receive the following

  (clang (ver (<player_name>) <min> <max>))

  to indicate what version of clang players support.

  * Added tackle variables to server.conf.  They still need to be added
  to the server_param messages.

  * Fixed  bugs in compression and decompression.  Thanks go to Hiroki Shimora
  for the patch.

  * Fixed error in reported direction of pointto.

  * Changed values of tackle and tackle fault which previously conflicted
  with ball collide and player collide

  * Fixed bug which saw all online coach commands parsed as offline coach
  commands.

  * Fixed bug in serialisation of player audio for pre-version 7 online
  coaches.

  * Fixed bug in penalty area flags being at +- 20.175, instead of +- 20.16

  * Recently the server has logged both messages sent and messages received.
  This sent messages are no longer logged for space reasons.  Later on this
  may be switchable via the server.conf

  * Fixed bug that caused server to sometimes output
  "../rcssbase/rcssbase/udpsocket.h: 307: Error receiving from client:
  Interrupted system call"

  * Fixed bug when online coach connects

  * Introduced rcssclangparser library for easy use of a clang parser in
  clients

  * Players can now tackle by using the tackle command in the form

  `(tackle <POWER>)'

  This renders the player immobile for 10 cycles.  The tackle success is
  determined randomly with the probability based of the ball's position
  relative to the tackling player using the following formula:

  fail_prob = ( player_2_ball.x / tackle_dist )^6
              + ( |player_2_ball.y| / 1.25 )^6;

  where tackle_dist is 2.5 if the ball is in front of the player and 0.5
  otherwise. Player_2_ball is a vector from the player to the ball, relative
  to the player's body direction.

  If the tackle is successfull, the ball is pushed in the direction of the
  players body.

  When players can see another players team, they can also see if that player
  is tackling via a `t' flag as follows:

  `((p "<TEAMNAME>" <UNUM>) <DIST> <DIR> <DISTCHG> <DIRCHG>
                            <BDIR> <HDIR> [<POINTDIR>] [t])'

  `((p "<TEAMNAME>") <DIST> <DIR> [<POINTDIR>] [t])'

  Players can get information about their tackling in the sense body message,
  where

  `(tackle (expires <EXPIRES>) (count <COUNT>))'

  is placed after the arm information.  EXPIRES is the number of cycles the
  current tackle will last for, with 0 indicating that the player isn't
  tackling.  COUNT is the number of times tackle has been executed by that
  player.

  Coach visuals now can indicate if a player is tackling via a `t' flag as
  follows:

  `((p "<TEAMNAME>" <UNUM>) <X> <Y> <VEL_X> <VEL_Y> <ANGLE> <NECK_ANGLE>
                            [<ARM_DIR>] [t])'

  * Rcssclient now supports very basic scripting.  The client will read from a
  file specified with the -script option and send one line immediately after
  receiving a sense body message.  Since the first to arguments are used to
  specify the host and port, one must specify these as well as the -script
  option.  For instance the following command:

  rcssclient localhost 6000 -script foobar

  will start the client using the script foobar.

  To send more than one message per cycle, simply put multiple messages on one
  line.  NOTE: When sending multiple messages, the say message must be last.

  * The pointto count is now incremented for both turning it on and turning
  it off.  Before pointto off commands would not affect the pointto count.

  * Players can now hear 1 msg per cycle from each team with a maximum length
  of 10 bytes.

  * Hear messages for version 8 and above players are now delayed to the
  beginning of the next cycle (after the sensebody message).

  * Version 8 and above players can now send attentionto commands to focus
  their attention on a particular player.  The command has the form:

  (attentionto <TEAM> <UNUM>) | (attentionto off)

  Where <TEAM> is

  opp | our | l | r | left | right | <TEAM_NAME>

  and <UNUM> is integer identifying a member of the team specified. Players
  can only focus on one player at a time (each attentionto command overrides
  the previous) and cannot focus on themselves.

  If the player focuses on player A from team T (AKA pTA), the player will hear
  one message selected randomly from the say messages issued by pTA in the
  previous cycle.  If pTA did not issue any say commands, the player will hear
  one message selected randomly from all the say messages issued by players in
  team T.  At the same time, the player will hear one message selected randomly
  from the other team.  If attentionto is off (default) the player will hear
  one message from each team selected randomly from the messages available.

  The current state of focus is reported in the sense body message to the
  player, where either of the follwing

  (focus (target none) (count <COUNT>))
  (focus (target {l|r} <UNUM>) (count <COUNT>)

  is added as the last element of the sense body message.

[8.03]
  * Full state messages now are sent without the redundant stamina
  data at the beginning of the message.

  * Landmark reader has been disabled due to problems on Solaris.

  * rcssclient now prints the port and host is is connecting to.

  * Players can now send commands to point to a spot on the field of
  the form:

    `(pointto <DIST> <DIR>)'

  or

    `(pointto off)'

  The first form will cause the arm to point to the spot DIST meters
  from the player in DIR direction, relative to the player's current
  face direction.
  The player will continue to point to the same location on the field
  independent of an motion or rotation of the player for at least
  `point_to_ban' cycles (5), and until another `pointto' command is
  issued or `point_to_duration' cycles (20) pass.
  The second form disables a previous call of `pointto'.

  * Version 8+ players can now see where a player is pointing, if the
  player is pointing, the player is in view and they are close enough
  to determine their team name. In these cases the player part of the
  `see' message has the form (without the newline):

    `(p "<TEAMNAME>" <UNUM>) <DIST> <DIR> <DISTCHG> <DIRCHG>
                             <BDIR> <HDIR> <POINTDIR>)'

  or

    `(p "<TEAMNAME>") <DIST> <DIR> <POINTDIR>)'

  Where `POINTDIR' is the direction the players are is pointing with
  random Gaussian (normal)noise added to the actual direction, with a
  mean of zero and a standard deviation calculated as follows:

    sigma = pow(dist / team_too_far_length, 4) * 178.25 + 1.75

  This means that sigma is a minimum of 1.75 deg and reaches 180 deg
  when the player is observing a pointing arm from a distance of
  team_too_far_length.  Since 95% of values in a normal distribution
  are within two standard deviations, then 95% of the time the noise
  will be in the range +- 2.5 deg when the player is very close and
  in the range +- 360.0 deg when the player is team_too_far_length
  away.  Beware the other 5% of cases ;)

  * Version 8+ coaches (on and offline) can see where a player is
  pointing to if the player is pointing.  The direction the player
  is pointing comes just after the players neck angle.

  * Fullstate messages have both <POINTDIST> and <POINTDIR> included
  between neck angle and stamina.  The players own arm state has the
  same format as in sense body (see below) and can be found between
  the count and score part.

  * sensebody messages for version 8+ clients now contain information
  about the arm actuator.  The following has been inserted into the
  sensebody message, just before the last `)', without the new line:

    `(arm (movable <MOVABLE>) (expires <EXPIRES>)
          (target <DIST> <DIR>) (count <COUNT>))'

  Where:

    - <MOVABLE> is the number of cycles till the arm is movable.
      0 indicates the arm is movable now

    - <EXPIRES> is the number of cycles till the arm stops pointing.
      0 indicates that the arm is no longer pointing,

    - <DIST> and <DIR> are the distance and direction of the point the
      player is pointing to, relative to the players location,
      orientation and neck angle, accurate to 10cm or 0.1 deg.

    - <COUNT> is the number of times the `pointto' command has been
      successfully executed by the player.


  * Server param has two new parameters:
    - `point_to_ban' is the minimum number of cycles between each
      successful `pointto' command.

    - `point_to_duration' is the number of cycles a `pointto' will last
      before expiring.

  * Use of the dedicated sockets is now enforced for version 8+ clients.
  Version 8+clients that send commands to the init sockets get the
  following reply

    (error only_init_allowed_on_init_port)

  and have their command(s) discarded.

  * If the server looses UDP connectivity with a client, the server will
  treat that client as though is sent bye or dispbye.

  * Added missing parameters to server_param. Please see serverparam.C
  for details of the new format.

  * Sensors have been rewritten to make the code cleaner, easier to
  maintain, easier to extend and best of all, faster! :D

  * Created warning message for version 8.0 and above players that send
  commands without null terminators.  This happens usually because
  players specify the length of the message with strlen, which does not
  include the null terminator.  The warning message has the format

    `(warning message_not_null_terminated)'

  * Added support for compressed communication with clients. clients can
  now send

    `(compression <level>)'

  to the server.  If the server is compiled without ZLib, the server
  will respond with

    `(warning compression_unsupported)'

  else if <level> is not a number between 0 and 9 inclusive, the server
  will respond with

    `(error illegal_command_form)'

  else the server will respond with

    `(ok compression <level>)'

  and all subsequent messages to that client will be compressed at that
  level, until a new compression command is received.

  If a compression level above zero is selected, then the client is
  expected to compress their commands to the server.

  Specifying a level of zero turns off compression completely (default).

  * The sample client supports the new compression option.  i.e. Compressed
  messages will be uncompressed before they are written to the console and
  commands to the server are compressed before sending.

  * Added a profile option to the server parameters. If profile is on and
  text logging is enabled, then the time take for different parts of the
  simulation cycle is written to the text log.  Default is off

  * Fixed bug in server's command line option parsing.

  * Fixed possible, but rare infinite loop in collision modelling.

See ChangeLog for previous changes.
