	has been set to 0, so that all the players are of same size by
	default. Two of the default values for the trade-off between
	stamina_inc_max and player_speed_max have been set to 0, so that
	the delta for player_speed_max is just random between its minumum
	and maximum value (dependend on nothing).

	Moved Points out of the Region hierarchy.

	Inverted the way CLang messages are constructed. Before they were built
	largest part first and each smaller bit added on.  Now they are built
	smallest part first.  This means the builder only needs to keep track
	of the base type of the current objects on the stack, whereas before it
	needed to keep track of the concrete type of each item.

	the parsing code for when clients send their commands without null
	terminators.

	* src/serverparam.C
	Fixed default value for kickoffoffside (aka forbid_kick_off_offside).
	Was false and should have been true.

	coaches.

	* src/netif.C
	* src/remoteclient.h

	Modified network code so that sends and receives are retried sometimes
	if they fail.  The send is retried it failed because of a signal
	interrupt or if the send would block.  The recv is retried only if it
	failed because of a signal interrupt.

	* src/visualsensor.cc
	Fixed bug in rendering of lines

	* src/landmarkreader.C
	Fixed error in penalty area width in landmark reader

	Fixed bug that caused server to sometimes output
	"../rcssbase/rcssbase/udpsocket.h: 307: Error receiving from client:
	Interrupted system call"

	* src/client.C
	Fixed bug that prevented non default parameters when using scripts

	* src/field.C
	Fixed bug when online coach connects

2002-02-15      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	Merged tackle branch

	* src/netif.C
	Added tackle info to coach visuals

	Merged attentionto branch into main branch.

	* src/audio.cc
	Fixed infinite loop caused by non-removal of cached audio messages

	* src/serializer.h
	Fixed lack of ends being sent to the serialised audio

	* src/serializer.h
	* src/audio.{cc|h}
	* src/netif.C
	Turns out the actual serializer bug seems to stem from using strings
	in pairs in containers.  Not sure what is going wrong, but the string
	is fine when it's inserted, but sometimes losses it's null terminator
	when it is extracted from the container.  Good thing is the problem is
	not there for c strings, so that is what is used now.  Currently each
	player audio cache creates a copy of the msg and deletes it when it's
	finised with it.  Later we should chage this so the message is stored
	one in a global cache and the player caches simple point to this.

	* src/serializer.{cc|h}
	Fixed bug with singleton implemtation of the serializers

	* src/client.{cc|h}
	Added very basic scripting support for rcssclient

	* src/arm.h
	Added increament of point count for pointto off commands

	* src/audio.cc
	Added increment of focus count.

	* src/object.C
	Added use of v8 audio builder for v8 players

2002-02-08      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/serverparam.{C|h}
	* src/playerparam.{C|h}

	out of filed.C and into main.C

	* src/main.C
	Cleaned up the SIGINT handler

	* src/player.cc
	Fixed tackle count

2002-02-06      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* NEWS
	* CHangeLog
	Updated for tackles.

	* src/player.{cc|h}
	* src/bodysensor.{C|h}
	Players can now get information about their tackling in sense body
	messages

	* src/player.{cc|h}
	* src/visualsensor.{cc|h}
	Players can now observer other players tackling.

	* src/player.cc
	* src/audio.h

	Changes SayMsgSize, hear_inc, hear_decay and hear_max to private and
	provided access functions. Remove their default values from param.h
	and replaced them with static members of ServerParam

2002-02-05      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/serverparam.h
	* src/player.cc
	Parameterised tackle components

	Converted ServerParam and PlayerParam classes into singletons

	* src/player.cc
	* src/player.h
	* src/types.h
	* src/field.C
	Introduced tackle command.  Tackling is probablistic, with the
	probability calculated as follows:

	if the ball is infront of the player then
	   prob = (player_2_ball.x/2.5)^6 + (|player_2_ball.y|/1.25)^6
        else
           prob = (-player_2_ball.x/0.5)^6 + (|player_2_ball.y|/1.25^6;

	* configure.in
	* config.h.bot
	* config.h.in
	Removed use of deprecated bzero and bcopy functions

2002-02-04  Oliver Obst  <fruit@robolog.org>

	* src/visualsensor.cc:
	fixed bug that the name of objects was not set in view quality
	low and a protocol version 7 or above.

2002-02-01      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in
	Fixed bug in FreeBSD support

2002-01-31      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/field.h
	Fixed bugs when SIGINT is received

2002-01-30	Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* Created tackle branch

	* src/param.h
	Changed default values for HEAR_MAX and HEAR_DECAY to one. Values
	which prevent the players from receiving at least one message per
	cycle will result in attentionto failing to work correctly.

	* src/player.cc
	Removed redundant stamina information from full_state_messages

	* src/field.C
	Removed use of atexit() do to problems on some solaris machines.
	This means that logs are only closed properly if the server is
	terminated with a SIGINT.

	* src/landmarkreader.{h|C}
	changed static const strings to static const char's, due to
	problems some compilers have initializing static const strings.

	* configure.in
	Removed check for libexpat, effectively disabling the landmark
	reader.  This was due to problems on some solaris machines

2002-01-29	Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/field.h
	* src/netif.C
	* src/player.C
	Put the players and the Coaches into a Listener container in the
	stadium.  The stadium takes all requests to send audio, by simply
	shuffle the container and then using the appropriate send*Audio
	method of the Listener.  The nice thing about the implementation
	is that the stadium doesn't need to know anything about the
	Listener, when to send to it or how the message needs to be
	formatted.


	* src/field.C
	* src/netif.C
	* src/audio.h
	* src/audio.cc
	* src/player.h
	* src/player.cc
	Created AudioSender_v8 and moved the new attentionto from player
	into it.

	* src/field.C
	* src/netif.C
	* src/object.C
	* src/audio.h
	* src/audio.cc
	I renamed the AudioSerializers to AudioSenders and moved all the
	responsibility for determining what to send, when to send it and
	then delegating the responsibility of sending the serialized
	data to the client via the clients transport.  The serialization
	task is still delegated to a generic (audio, visual, etc)
	serializer.

2002-01-28	Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/audio.h
	* src/field.C
	* src/field.h
	* src/netif.C
	* src/serializer.h
	Interated new audio serializers for coaches

	* src/netif.C
	* src/object.C
	* src/player.h
	Interated new audio serializers for players

	* src/audio.h
	* src/audio.cc
	* src/serializer.h
	* src/serializer.cc
	* src/Makefile.am
	Created audio serializers and general serializers.  The audio
	serializer has the job of preparing the data that is then
	serialized by the general serializer.  The general serializers
	should not do any data manipulation, nor have conditionals and
	they should be stateless (infact they are flyweight singletons).
	In the long term the intention is to have the general
	serializers used to serialize all messages to clients via
	specific serializers (like the audio serializer) that prepare
	the data for the general serializer.

	* src/player.h
	Created PlayerEar class used for attnetionto.  This will probably
	be moved and intergated into audio.h

2002-01-23	Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/player.cc
	* src/field.h
	Added parsing of attentionto commands for players.

2002-01-22	Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* Created attentionto branch

	* src/client.{h|cc}
	Fixed bug which would prevent the rcssclient from using default
	parameters.
	rcssclient now prints out the port and host it is connecting to.

	* src/netif.C
	Fixed bug which would not allow coaches to connect

	* src/netif.C
	Fixed bug that would prevent clients from reconnecting

	* src/field.C
	* src/gzfstream.h

	and changed all other instances of strstream to use internally
	managed memory to store the string.

2002-01-21      Tom Howard      <tomhoward@users.sf.net>

	* src/player.cc
	Fixed bug in fullstate messages for pointing

	* src/arm.h
	* src/field.C
	* src/visualsensor.cc
	Added noise to pointing observation.  Player will see the
	direction the arm is pointing in with random gaussian (normal)
	noise added to the actual direction, with a mean of zero and a
	standard deviation calculated as follows:

	  sigma = pow(dist / team_too_far_length, 4) * 178.25 + 1.75

	This means that sigma is a minimum of 1.75 deg and reaches 180 deg
	when the player is observing a pointing arm from a distance of
	team_too_far_length.  Since 95% of values in a normal distribution
	are within two standard deviations, then 95% of the time the noise
	will be in the range +- 2.5 deg when the player is very close and
	in the range +- 360.0 deg when the player is team_too_far_length
	away.
	Sense body message will report a players arm target acurate to 10cm
	and 0.1 degrees
	Arm timer is now incremented every cycle.

	* src/random.h
	* src/random.cc
	* src/Makefile.am
	* src/field.C
	Created random.{h|cc} by modifying boost/random.  This provided
	classes	for random number generation using a fast gerneator and
	allowing various distributions (including normal.)  The defalut RNG
	is a singleton and is initialized and destroyed in field.C using
	thes seed in player.conf or the current time is the player.conf
	seed is	zero.

	Switched back to dedicated sockets for each client.  Use of the
	dedicated socket is enforced for version 8+ clients.  Version 8+
	clients that send commands to the init sockets get the following
	reply

	  (error only_init_allowed_on_init_port)

	and have their command(s) discarded.

	The server also uses connect() on each dedicated socket.  If the
	connection on that socket is lost, the client is treated as
	though it send bye or dispbye.

	classes.

2001-11-28      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Created VisualSensor classes and BallVisualSensor classes. Still
	need to create VisualSensor classes for the other objects.

2001-11-27      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Created ServerParamSensor classes
	* Created PlayerParamSensor classes
	* Created PlayerTypeSensor classes

2001-11-26      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Converted all versions of sense_body output to use classes inherited
	from BodySensor.  Players inherit BodySensor_v7 (well, actually you
	should mentally think of the BodySensor_vN classes as interfaces and
	that the Player implements a BodySensor_vN) and have methods for
	sending each version.

	* Added player.{h|cc} and move player class and methods to these files

	* Fixed some bugs in the new visuals

	* Added bodysensor.{h|cc} with bodysensor classes

2001-11-23      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Moved compression to RemoteClient class.  Clients are expected to
	send commands to the server at the same compression level that has been
	specified with the `(compression <level>)' command.  At this stage only
	Players use the RemoteClient class

	* Created warning message for version 8.0 and above players that send
	commands without null terminators.  This happens ususally because
	players specify the length of the message with strlen, which does not
	include the null terminator.  The warning message has the format
	(warning message_not_null_terminated).

2001-11-22      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Added new UDPSocket and RemoteClient classes

2001-11-21      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Added support for compressed comunication to players.  Players can
	now send

	`(compression <level>)'

	to the server.  If the server is compiled without ZLib, the server
	will respond with

	`(warning compression_unsupported)'

	else if <level> is not a number between 0 and 9 inclusive, the server
	will respond with

	`(error illegal_command_form)'

	else the server will respond with

	`(ok compression <level>)'

	and all subsequest messages to that player will be compressed at that
	level, until a new compression command is received.  Specifying a level
	of zero turns off compression completly.


2001-11-20      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Fixed bug in visuals for close objects that I introduce on the
	2001-11-14.

2001-11-19      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Changed default values for send_comms and record_messages to false.

2001-11-15      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Fixed bug in game logs which resulted in the team_t structure only
	ever being written for one side.

	* Fixed bug in text log which resulted in no data being written when
	compressed logging was enabled

2001-11-14      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Removed string comparisons from sensor rendering. On my system this
	reduced the average time per cycle to render from 12ms to 4ms!

	* First attempt a simplifying the rendering of visuals failed.  The
	result was much cleaner in terms of code, but was about twice as slow,
	so I've commented out the code in sensor.{Ch} and started again

	* Added a profile option to the server parameters. If profile is on and
	text logging is enabled, then the time take for different parts of the
	simulation cycle is written to the text log.  Default is off

	* Changed the default value for ball_rand from 0.2 (very old) to 0.05
	as reported in the manual

2001-11-12      Tom Howard      <thomashoward@email.com>

	* Completed basic implementation of new visual classes. Still not
	activated, needs to be tested and have bugs removed.

2001-11-09	Tom Howard	<thomashoward@email.com>

	* Added VisualLine and VisualFlag to sensor.{Ch}

2001-11-07	Tom Howard	<thomashoward@email.com>

	* Created sensor.h and sensor.C files which contain new classes for
	generating sensory information in current protocol and XML.  These
	are not actually used by the server, yet.

	* Changed to using standard ChangeLog format for all the ChangeLogs.

[8.03]
        Fixed bug in server's command line option parsing.

	Fixed possible, but rare infinte loop in collision modelling

[8.02]
	Removed bug in server which sent incorrect error messages when parsing
	some say commands that contained brackets in the message.  There is
	still a slight problem when sending concatenated commands to the
	server in that the say message must always be last.

        Removed bug which allowed a monitor to have multiple connections
        to the one server

	The server now compiles without error with gcc-3.0

	The server now supports compressed logging.  `text_log_compression'
	and `game_log_compression' are used to regulate the speed of
	compression,  where 0 indicates no compression and 9 indicates the
	best compression (slowest). The default is 0.

	The server now renames the text logs and game logs to
	`<TEAM_L>_<TEAM_L_POINTS>-vs-<TEAM_R>_<TEAM_R_POINTS>.rcl' and
	`<TEAM_L>_<TEAM_L_POINTS>-vs-<TEAM_R>_<TEAM_R_POINTS>.rcg'
	respectively. `rcl' stands for `RoboCup Command Log'. `rcg' stands for
	`RoboCup Game'.

	The Log files are saved in the directories specified by
	the `text_log_dir' and `game_log_dir' parameters respectively.

	Fixed logging names can be specified using the `text_log_fixed' and
	`game_log_fixed'.  The files will be saved with the names specfied
	by `text_log_fixed_name' and `game_log_fixed_name' each with the `.rcl'
	or `.rcg' suffix respectively.

	When fixed logging is disabled, a date stamp can be prepended to the
	output names if `text_log_dated' or `game_log_dated' is on. The format
	can be specified with `log_date_format'.  See `man strftime' for
	details on the format string.

	Logging can be turned on and off using `text_logging' and
	`game_logging'.

	The version of the game log is specified with `game_log_version'.

	Player commands will be recorded in the game log if `record_messages'
	is on.

	Player commands will be sent to the monitors is `send_comms' is on.

	Removed use of <sstream> as it is not supported in gcc-2.95.2.  The
	use of this was only introduced in 8.01

	Changed protocol for full state for clients connecting with a version
	8.0 or above protocol to (without the line breaks):

	  fullstate : (fullstate <time>
	                (pmode {goalie_catch_ball_{l|r}|<play mode>})
			(vmode {high|low} {narrow|normal|high})
			(stamina <stamina> <effort> <recovery>)
			(count <kicks> <dashes> <turns> <catches> <moves>
		            <turn_necks> <change_views> <says>)
			(score <team_points> <enemy_points>)
			((b) <pos.x> <pos.y> <vel.x> <vel.y>)
			<players>)

	  players : {<player>|<player> <players>}

	  player : ((p {l|r} <unum> {g|<player_type_id>}) <pos.x> <pos.y>
	             <vel.x> <vel.y> <body_angle> <neck_angle>)

[8.01]
        Created a landmark reader which reads the positions of the landmarks
	on the field from an xml file. Currently it will only read flags, but
	this will be extended to include lines, pitch, goals and penalty areas.
	The landmark reader requires the expat library.  If expat is not on the
	system, the server will use default landmarks and will not read or
	create the ~/.rcssserver-landmark.xml file.  Future versions will
	comunicate to the clients at startup the postions of landmarks.

	Placed checks for `nan' in client command parser.  If a `nan' is
	detected, the server replies with `(error illegal_command_form)'.

	Fixed small problem with rcssclient, which resulted in linking errors.

	Changed protocol for parameters and hetro-types for clients connecting
	with a version 8.0 or above protocol to:

	  (server_param (goal_width <value>) (player_size <value>) ... )
	  (player_param (player_types <value>) (subs_max <value>) ... )
	  (player_type (id <value>) (player_speed_max <value>) ... )

	Fixed bug which allowed players to send monitor commands

	Server will remove monitors from the monitor list after they send
	`(dispbye)'.  By using this, monitors can connect and disconnect
	as offen as required without affecting the game.

	Changed protocol for full state for clients connecting with a version
	8.0 or above protocol to (without the line breaks):

	  fullstate : (fullstate <time>
	                (pmode {goalie_catch_ball_{l|r}|<play mode>})
			(score <team_points> <enemy_points>)
			((b) <pos.x> <pos.y> <vel.x> <vel.y>)
			<players>)

	  players : {<player>|<player> <players>}

	  player : ((p {l|r} <unum> {g|<player_type_id>}) <pos.x> <pos.y>
	             <vel.x> <vel.y> <body_angle> <neck_angle>
		     (vmode {high|low} {narrow|normal|high})
		     (stamina <stamina> <effort> <recovery>)
		     (count <kicks> <dashes> <turns> <catches> <moves>
		            <turn_necks> <change_views> <says>))
[8.00]
	Moved to using automake and autoconf.

	renamed to rcssserver

	server will now look for config files under ~/.rcssserver-server.conf
	and ~/.rcssserver-player.conf, unless -sfile of -pfile are specified.
	If a config file does not exist a default (Seattle settings) file is
	created.

	The sample client is now named rcssclient and will be built if
	the `--enable-rcssclient' option is given to `./configure'

[7.11]
 * Added options for this years evaluation session.
   `slowness_on_top_for_left_team' adjusts `player_speed_max',
   `player_accel_max' and `dash_power_rate' for all players on the left team
   when they are in the top half of the field. `slowness_on_top_for_right_team'
   does the same for players on the right team.  The value of these options are
   sent to players in the server_param message only if they connect to the
   server specifying version 7.11 or above.

 * There was a typo in the coach_lang_grammar file. 'pmode' should
   have been 'playm'

 * A "synchronized mode" has been added to the simulator. The server
   will operate in this mode if you provide the synch_mode flag. Here
   is how the synchronous mode works:

   - Cycles no longer take a fixed amount of time.
   - Each cycle, the server determines which messages will be sent to
     the players before 60ms (synch_offset) into the cycle. All of
     those messages are sent.
   - The server then sends "(think)" to all the agents (coach and
     trainer included)
   - At this point, the agents should do their action selection and
     send commands to the server. The server processes commands as
     they come in.
   - The agents should then send "(done)" to the server. Once the
     server has received "(done)" from all agents, it will advance to
     the next cycle

   Note that the server will allow a few cycles to go by without
   receiving a (done) from all the agents, and will print a warning
   when it is doing so.

 * There is a new option in the player parameters 'random_seed'. It
   allows you to specify the random seed for generating heterogeneous
   types (in order to reproducible types). Using the same seed will
   give you exactly the same player types.

[7.10]
 * Fixed bug in new collision detection/modelling.  If the mode is not playon,
   collisions with the ball will not move it.

[7.09]
 * Fixed bug in collision detection/modelling. In the old impementation, it
   was possible for object A to collide with object B, but object B would not
   collide with object A.  As such object A would be repositioned and have
   its velocity multiplied by -0.1, and nothing would happen to object B.
   The new implementation checks for collisions against every object strictly
   after every object has been moved.  When the server detects a collision
   between two objects, it calculates a new postion for both objects. After
   every object has been checked for collision, the server then moves all the
   objects that have collided to their collision position, or the average of
   it's collision positions if the object collided with multiple objects.
   The detection and movement process is repeated until no more collisions
   are detected or a maxiumum of 10 times.  This is so objects that are moved
   because of a collision are then checked to see if that movement may have
   caused a collision with another object.  As a last step, each object that
   has been recorded in one or more collisions has it's velocity multiplied
   by -0.1.
 * Increased maximum packet size to from the server to 8K. This mainly
   has implications for the coach and the coach language. In
   particular, the actual message part of a coach 'say' command should
   be no more than: 8192-38 = 8154 characters long (i.e. in (say STR),
   the length of STR should be no more than 8154). This is to allow
   the proper formatting for the message sent to the players to remain
   under 8K.

[7.08]
  * Fixed logplayer for Solaris (was broken in 7.05 by the
    introduction of a usleep command)
  * Coach language change: The mark and markl directives now take a
    unum set instead of just a unum
  * Coach language change: The ppos directive is now
   | (ppos <TEAM> <UNUM_SET> <INT> <INT> <REGION>)
   where the first int specifies the minimum number of players and the
   second specifies the maximum number of players for unum_set which
   have to be in region in order for the condition to match;
  * Coach language change: The <POINT> type can now be relative to
    another point, the ball, or a player.
    <POINT> -> (pt [real] [real]) #xcoord, ycoord
	      | (pt [real] [real] <POINT>)
              | (pt ball)
	      | (pt <TEAM> <UNUM>)
  * in 7.07, a space was accidentally removed from the online coach
    messages (right before TIME_RECEIVED_BY_SERVER). This has been
    fixed.
  * Removed references to SA_RESETHAND which were having no effect.
  * Fixed setting of player type in new display/logging.

[7.07]
  * Pre V7 online coach messages to v7 and above players are quoted.
  * Pre V7 online coach messages are sent to all players.
  * Offline coach messages to v7 players are quoted and have coach as
    origin (rather than referee)

    A summary of audio format is

      From referee
	(hear TIME referee PLAY_MODE)
      From offline coach
	(hear TIME coach "MSG")
      From pre V7 online coach (sent to all players)
	(hear TIME online_coach_{left|right} "MSG")
      From V7 and above online coach
	(hear TIME online_coach_{left|right} TIME_RECEIVED_BY_SERVER CLANG_MSG)
      From player to itself
	(hear TIME self "MSG")
      From player to others
	(hear TIME DIR "MSG")


  * The logplayer did not send server param, player param, and player
    type messages. This has been fixed.
  * The monitor would crash on some logfiles because stamina_max
    seemed to be set to 0. The monitor will no longer crash this way.

[7.06]
  * Fixed a bug where version 7.xx online coach messages were never
    sent to the right team. Thank you to Timo Steffens for finding and
    fixing this bug.

[7.05]
  * Soccer server will now work with Windows NT/2000 with Cygwin
    installed, though it has not been heavily tested. The logplayer
    and monitor do not work as yet. Cygwin is available from
    http://cygwin.com/
  * A bug was fixed in the sending of the coach messages. Previously,
    quotes were put around part of messages in the standard coach
    language. These quotes have been removed.
  * Fixed memory leak in collision checking.
    Thanks to Artur Merke and Andreas Hoffman for finding it at for
    the fix.
  * For quite some time, the logplayer has occasionally "skipped" so
    that certain cycles were never displayed by the logplayer. This
    seems to be caused by the logplayer sending too many UDP packets
    for the monitor to receive. Therefore, a new parameter has been
    added to the logplayer 'message_delay_interval'. After sending
    that many messages, the logplayer sleeps for 1 microsecond, giving
    the monitor a chance to catch up. This is not a guaranteed to
    work, but it seems to help significantly. If you still have a
    problem with the logplayer/monitor "skipping", try reducing
    message_delay_interval from it's default value of 10. Setting
    message_delay_interval to a negative number causes there to be no
    delay.
  * The server used to truncate messages received from the players and
    coach to 128 characters before recording them in the logfile. This
    has been fixed.


[7.04]
  * If a client connects with version > 7.0, all angles sent out by
    the server are rounded instead of truncated (as they were
    previously) This makes the error from quantization of angles
    (i.e. conversion of floats to ints) both uniform throughout the
    domain and two sided. This change was also made to all values put
    into the dispinfo_t structure for the monitors and logfiles.
  * Fixed a bug which misrecorded the the span angle in the arc region.
  * Fixes a bug where no space was printed after send_vi_step in the
    server_param message (thanks to Peter Stone for pointing this out)

[7.03]
  * Added a new parameter drop_ball_time. If the play mode remains in
    any free kick mode for one team (kick_off_{left,right},
    corner_kick_{left,right}, free_kick_{left,right}, etc) for
    drop_ball_time cycles, the ball will automatically be dropped. In
    accordance with past competition rules, if the ball is in a
    penalty area, it will be dropped on the nearest inside corner.
    (contributed by Oliver Obst)
  * Changes to allow the server to compile on NetBSD systems.
  * Players now continue to receive see messages when fullstate_[lr]
    is turned on.

[7.02]
  * Minor modification to get compilation on Linux RedHat 7.0 systems.
  * Fix to the server.conf file to correctly set ball_accel_max
  * An error message is now printed if there is an unrecognized option
    in a .conf file
  * Fix to the coach language implementation to allow the use of named
    actions.
  * Fix to the coach language parsing. Previously, because of the use
    of a static buffer, use of multiple defined things in one message
    were incorrectly interpreted.
  * Visual angle is server_param message is now reported in degrees
    instead of radians.
  * A new command has been added to the monitor protocol:
    (dispplayer SIDE UNUM POSX POSY ANG)
    SIDE: 1 (for left) | -1 (for right)
    UNUM: 1--11
    POSX, POSY: new position, each coordinate will be divided by
                SHOWINFO_SCALE
    ANG: The new angle of the player, in degrees
    (contributed by Artur Merke)
  * Two new parameters (fullstate_l and fullstate_r) have been added
    which enable sending the full state of the world to the players on
    the left and right teams respectively. This is for debugging purposes
    only, and will never be turned on in a competition. The players
    will not receive visual information. Instead, immediately after
    each sense_body, they will receive a string in the following format
    (fullstate TIME (pmode MODE) (vmode QUALITY WIDTH) (score LSCORE RSCORE)
      (ball POSX POSY VELX VELY)
      (PLAYERNAME POSX POSY VELX VELY BODYANG NECKANG STAMINA EFFORT RECOVERY)
       ...)
    MODE: any of the normal playmodes, as well as
    goalie_catch_ball_[lr]
    QUALITY: high | low
    WIDTH: narrow | normal | wide
    NECKANG: is in the relative neck angle
    PLAYERNAME: format is [lr]_NUM (for example: l_1, r_6)

    The value of these parameters go at the end of the server_param
    message.
    (contributed by Artur Merke)


[7.01]
  * Play stops and players are recovered every half_time cycles
  * Score command added having the format
	(score)
    To which the server replies
	(score <time> <your_score> <enemy_score>)
  * Some cosmetic changes to coach_lang.[yh] and coach_lang_comp.[Ch],
    including fixing a "bug" dealing with quotes in define
    messages. The external behavior of the server should be unchanged.
  * Fixed a bug in the count of freeform messages said by the coach
    which caused all messages to be included in the freeform message
    count.
  * Server now processes all commands from both trainer and coach
    instead every recv_step. Previously, only the last message on the
    socket was processed.
  * Added two new parameters start_goal_l and start_goal_r which are
    is the starting score of the game.
  * Online coaches no longer hear any messages from on online coach
    (themselves or the opponents coach)
  * Coach and trainers connecting with version >= 7.0 get the new
    short player format in hear messages
    (p "TEAMNAME" num) instead of (player TEAMNAME num)
  * Small changes to the coach language.
    * Add a definition type for actions: (definea "[string]" ACTION)
    * Move the time to live value from the messages level to the token
      level. New token format: (<TIME> <CONDITION> <DIRECTIVE_LIST)
      Advice and info messages no longer contain the time to live.

[7.00]
  * Added support for the new coach language. The grammar can be found
    in the file "coach_lang_grammar". For semantics, please see the
    discussion from the coach-l list:
    http://www.coral.cs.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/coach-l

	Note that now you must have flex and bison in order to compile
	the server. These utilities can be found at
	http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html
	http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html

	The following parameters have been added: clang_win_size,
	clang_define_win, clang_meta_win, clang_advice_win,
	clang_info_win, clang_mess_delay, clang_mess_per_cycle

	Each online coach (which connects with version >= 7.0) can
	send clang_define_win(1) define messages, clang_meta_win(1)
	meta messages, clang_advice_win(1) advice messages, and
	clang_info_win (1) info messages per clang_win_size(100)
	cycles. Note that if any of the clang_*_win parameters are
	negative, then there is no restriction on that type of
	message. The messages are heard by the players
	clang_mess_delay(50) cycles after being received by the
	server.

	If the play mode is not play on, clang_mess_per_cycle (1)
	coach message(s) are sent to the players each cycles,
	regardless of whether the clang_mess_delay time for each
	message has elapsed. Further, messages *sent* while the play
	mode is not play_on do not count towards the clang_*_win
	limits.

	Note that the server will always send messages to the players
	in the same order which they were received from the coach.

	The restrictions say_coach_cnt_max and say_coach_msg_size
	still apply to "freeform" messages (see the grammar).

	Further the format for the hear command of the coach has
	change slightly, it is now
	(hear <TIME_SENT> online_coach_{left,right} <TIME_RECEIVED> <MESSAGE>)

  * Included the head angle into the display of the soccermonitor
    (source conributed by Ken Nguyen)

  * Added Hetro Player support and substitusions.

	Player types ( 7 including default type ) are generated randomly
	when the server starts. the random types are based on predifined
	tradeoffs which can be adjusted from the player.conf file.

	On connecting to the server, clients (v7.0+) receive player type
    	information.

    	The online coach can change player types unlimited times in
    	before_kick_off play_mode and change player types 3 times during
	other non-playon play_modes using the following command:

	    (change_player_type <UNUM> <PLAYER_TYPE>)

	where UNUM is the uniform number of the player and PLAYER_TYPE is
	a number from 0 to 6 specifying one of the 7 player types, where
	0 is the default player type.

	The server responds to the online coach with:

	    (warning cannot_sub_while_playon) 	If the play_mode is playon.
	    (warning no_team_found)		If the coach has no team
						( should never happen ).
	    (warning no_subs_left)		If the coach has made it's
						3 subs for the game.
	    (error illegal_command_form)	If change_player_type is
						not followed by two integers
						and a close bracket.
	    (warning max_of_that_type_on_field) If the player_type is not
						the default and there are
						3 of that type already on
						the field.
	    (warning no_such_player)		If there is no player with
						that uniform number on the
						team.
	    (warning cannot_change_goalie)	If the coach tries to change
						the player type of the
						goalie.
	    (ok change_player_type UNUM TYPE)	If the substitution was made.

	The server responds to the teammates with:

	    (change_player_type UNUM TYPE)

	and opponents ( including opponent coach ) with:

	    (change_player_type UNUM)

	If substituitions are made before a client connects to the server,
	the are advised of the substituitions made via one of the above two
	messages for each substitution made.

	The offline coach can change player types any time with the
	following command:

	    (change_player_type <TEAM_NAME> <UNUM> <PLAYER_TYPE>)

	where TEAM_NAME is the name of the team on whioch the change is to
	be made.

	The server responds to the offline coach with:

	    (warning no_team_found)		If the team does not exist.
	    (error illegal_command_form)	If change_player_type is
						not followed by a string,
						two integers and a close
						bracket.
	    (warning no_such_player)		If there is no player with
						that uniform number on that
						team.
    	    (ok change_player_type TEAM UNUM TYPE)	If the substitution
							was made.

	The server responds to teammates and opponents as usual and adivises
	the teams coach in the same way as the team members.

  * Added initalisation message for offline coaches in the following format:
	(init (version <VER>))
    to which to the server responds with
	(init ok)
    Initalising a offline coach with the new init message does not start the
    server.

  * Added start command for offline coaches using new init message, with the
    following format:
	(start)
    to which the server responds with
	(ok start)

  * Changed visual information for (online and offline) coaches connecting with version
    7 or higher.
	- visual information stats with "see_global" instead of "see"
	- Short names are used.
	- The body and head angles have been moved to the end of the object info.  The
	  new grammer is
		ObjInfo ::= (ObjName Pos) |
			    (ObjName Pos Velocity) |
			    (ObjName Pos Velocity Angles)

  * Added server_param message for players and coaches connecting with version 7 or
    above. It has the following format:

	(server_param <gwidth> <inertia_moment> <psize> <pdecay> <prand> <pweight>
	 <pspeed_max> <paccel_max> <stamina_max> <stamina_inc> <recover_init>

	 <land_qstep_r> <dir_qstep_l> <dir_qstep_r> <CoachMode> <CwRMode> <old_hear>
	 <sv_st>)

  * Added player_param message for players and coaches connecting with version 7 or
    above. It has the following format:

	(player_param <player_types> <subs_max>	<pt_max>
	 <player_speed_max_delta_min> <player_speed_max_delta_max>
	 <stamina_inc_max_delta_factor>	<player_decay_delta_min>
	 <player_decay_delta_max> <inertia_moment_delta_factor>
	 <dash_power_rate_delta_min> <dash_power_rate_delta_max>
	 <player_size_delta_factor> <kickable_margin_delta_min>
	 <kickable_margin_delta_max> <kick_rand_delta_factor>
	 <extra_stamina_delta_min> <extra_stamina_delta_max>
	 <effort_max_delta_factor> <effort_min_delta_factor>)

  * Added player_type message for players and coaches connecting with version 7 or
    above. It has the following format:

	(player_type <id> <player_speed_max> <stamina_inc_max> <player_decay>
	 <inertia_moment> <dash_power_rate> <player_size> <kickable_margin>
	 <kick_rand> <extra_stamina> <effort_max> <effort_min>)

  * Added Quotation marks around the message part of a hear messege from players and
    coaches for players and coaches connecting with version 7 or above.

  * Added catch count, move count and change_view count to sense_body
    for players connecting to version 7 with above.

  * Externalised the config file reader into a generic reader which
    is used for reading server.conf and for reading player.conf which
    has settings for hetro players.

  * Added striplog to tools directory.

  * Added exteamname to tools directory.

  * Added tools directory.  Programs in tools directory need to be
    explicitly compiled.

  * In server.conf, changed stamina_max from 3500 to 4000,
    stamina_inc_max from 35 to 45, kick_power_rate from 0.016 to
    0.027, and baccel_max from 1.6 to 2.7

  * Added log_times parameter to server.conf for loging ms between cycles

  * Added coach commands to command log

  * Added BALL_COLLIDE and PLAYER_COLLIDE to player's alive member.
    BALL_COLLIDE signifies that the player collided with the ball.
    PLAYER_COLLIDE signifies that the player collided with another player.
    The monitor displays both types with a black circle around the player.

  * Introduced new monitor and logging protocol
    Monitor protocol version 2 format:
	A repeated series of dispinfo_t2 structs specifing game state

    Only monitors connecting with:
	(dispinit version 2)
    will recieve data in the new format

    Logging protocol version 3 format:
	file starts with "UGL" and version number (3), followed by a
	a series of shorts, specifying the type of data structure and
	the data structures specified.

	Each short specifying mode is followed by
	i)	if mode == PM_MODE,
			a char specifying play mode.

	ii)	if mode == TEAM_MODE,
			a team_t struct for the left side and
			a team_t struct for the right side.

	iii)	if mode == SHOW_MODE,
			a short_showinfo_t2 struct specifying ball and
			player positions and states.

	iv)	if mode == MSG_MODE,
			a short specifying the message board,
			a short specifying the length of the message,
			a string containing the message.

	v)	if mode == PARAM_MODE,
			a server_params_t struct specifying the current server
			parameters.

	vi)	if mode == PPARAM_MODE
			a player_params_t struct specifying the current hetro
			player parameters.

	vii)	if mode == PT_MODE,
			a player_type_t struct specifying the parameters of a
			specific player type.

    Play mode is only written if the playmode changes.
    Team data is only written if a new team connects or the score changes.
    Server parameters are only written once at the beginning of the logfile.
    Hetro player parameters are only written once at the beginning of the
    logfile.
    Player type info is only written once for each player type at the beginning
    of the logfile.

    Data Conversion:
    Values such as x, y positions are meters multiplied by SHOWINFO_SCALE2.

    Values such as deltax, deltay are meters/cycle multiplied by
    SHOWINFO_SCALE2.

    Values such as body_angle, head_angle and view_width are in radians multiplied
    by SHOWINFO_SCALE2.

    Other values such as stamina, effort and recovery have also been multiplied by
    SHOWINFO_SCALE2.

  * Fixed logging so that the last cycle of a game is logged.

  * Sense body information is now always sent to players before visual
    information. Previously, if a player was due to recieve visual
    information at the begining of a cycle the visual information would
    be sent before the sense body information.

  * Added missing initialization for part of sigaction structures
    (contributed by Frank Rehberger)

[6.07]
  (These changes were made for the evaluation session of RoboCup2000)
  * Added a parameter kick_rand which to add noise directly to the
    kick command of the players. It is used the same way as
    player_rand or ball_rand
  * Added parameters team_actuator_noise: (on/off) whether the
    following params are used
  * prand_factor_l, prand_factor_r: The player_rand value is
    multiplied by this (for the left and right teams) to get the
    actual noise level
  * kick_rand_factor_l, kick_rand_factor_r: The kick_rand value is
    multiplied by this (for the left and right teams) to the get the
    actual noise level.

[6.06]
  * A new parameter 'slow_down_factor' (default 1) has been
    added. This parameter can used to slow the server down by an
    integer factor. Specifically, the following values are multiplied
    by slow_down_factor after option processing: simulator_step,
    send_step, send_vi_step, sense_body_step. Note however that this
    parameter does *not* affect the length of half-time. The number of
    cycles in a half is calculated as if slow_down_factor does not
    exist.

[6.05]
  * The say_coach_cnt_max parameter now limits the number of messages
    which the online coach can say. The parameter existed before but
    had no effect. The online coach receives (error said_too_many_messages)
    if it trys to say too many messages. A value < 0 for say_coach_cnt_max
    turns off the limit on the number of messages.
  * If the game continues into extended_time, the online coaches are
    given an additional say_coach_cnt_max messages to say every
    additional 3000 cycles (or whatever the normal length game
    is). The first additional messages are given at the start of
    extended time. Allowed messages are cumulative.

[6.04]
  * Made the ball move immediately when the goalie issues a move
    command after a catch. Previoulsy, the goalie could see the ball
    in it's old location after the goalie moved.

[6.03]
  * The angle reported in the speed field of sense_body is now
    normalized.
  * (Also note that in the visual info, the teamname in enclosed in
    quotes. This was present in a previous release, but was not
    mentioned in this file)

[6.02]
  * Goalie is now identified in the visual info. This is only seen
    only when the player's uniform number is also seen. The object
    string in the visual info for seeing the goalie is:
    (p "<team_name>" <num> goalie). Visual info is unchanged
    otherwise. This affects all clients which connect with version
    >=6.00

[6.01]
  * Fixed a bug that caused the server to send B instead of G for a
    goal that was very close

[6.00]
  * The speed entry of sense_body now contains two arguments: (speed r
    ang) where r is the magnitude of the player's velocity and ang is
    the angle relative to the player's view angle.
    << ") (speed " << Quantize(vel.r(), 0.01) << " "
    << Rad2IDeg(vel.th() - angle_body - angle_neck_committed)
  * The visual information has been shortened. All object names are
    now a single character long.
	Old       New
	flag      f
	player    p
	ball      b
	line      l
	goal      g
    The versions with capital letters (for felt objects) are just
    capital single letters.
  * Added vector addition for kicks with a maximum acceleration of 1.6m/c
  * Added a parameter goalie_max_moves (default 2) which limits the
    number of times the goalie can move after a catch. A negative
    parameter allows infinite moves. "(error too_many_moves)" is sent
    to the client if it tries to move too many times.
  * Online coach connecting with (init TeamName) now receives a (init
    Side ok) reply.
  * Coach (on- or offline) can now send an (team_names) command and receives
    (ok team_names [(team Side1 TeamName1) [(team Side2 TeamName2)]])
  * Offline coach (aka trainer) can send (recover) to reset players'
    stamina, recovery, effort and hear_capacity to the values at the
    beginning of the game. The server replies with (ok recover).
  * Added the following PlayMode items and a flag for player status.
	[enum PlayMode]
	PM_PK_{Left|Right}, PM_FirstHalfOver, PM_Pause, PM_Human,
	PM_Foul_Charge_{Left|Right}, PM_Foul_Push_{Left|Right},
	PM_Foul_MultipleAttacker_{Left|Right},
	PM_Foul_BallOut_{Left|Right}
	[player status]
	#define LOST			0x0200
    These additions are required from infrastructure group who
    try to develop 3D viewer, commentator and logger for small size league.
    The change will not affect normal behavior of Soccer Server
    as a platform for the simulation league.

[5.27]
  * Fixed a bug which caused sensory info to be sent 4 times too often.
  * Fixed a bug with popup windows in monitor which caused the monitor
    to crash on some systems.
  * For the logplayer's record mechanism, changed the length field to
    be in network byte order

[5.26]
  * Fixed a bug where the ball would sometimes stick to a player other
    than the goalie after a catch
  * Fixed a bug where if the goalie ran out of bounds with the ball, a
    corner kick or goal was not correctly assigned
  * The length field in version 2 of the logfile is now put into
    network byte order
  * fixed problems with sensory information coming in 160ms intervals
    rather than 150ms.
  * fixed the problem that this sensory information could become out
    of sync with the server. i.e. a 160ms (or 150ms) cycle could (in
    some cases) become extended to 170ms or 180ms etc. whilst still
    maintaining a 100ms simulator cycle.
  * Fixed problems with signal being lost if the server was busy when
    they arrived

[5.25]
  * Fix a bug that the referee sometimes misjudges "goal"s.
	(reported by Mikhail Prokopenko and Jan Colin Murray)
  * Parameters for quantization_step_* can be set separately for each team.
	(for evaluation)

[5.24]
  * Fix a bug of logplayer that behaves strange way when goto mode.

[5.23]
  * Fix a bug that sense_body does not send version-4's format.
	(reported by Patrick. F Riley)
  * Apply a patch contributed by Klaus Dorer to netif.C.
    Now, the server check all messages from clients.

[5.22]
  * Fix a bug that sense_body information is sent in version-5 format
    even if the client connects with version-4 format.
    (reported by Patrick F Riley)
  * Fix a bug that messages said by online-coachs are informed as
    referee's messages.
    Now, onlin-coaches' messages are informed as the following format:
	(hear TIME online_coach_right MESSAGE)
	(hear TIME online_coach_left MESSAGE)
    (reported by Patrick F Riley and Emiel Corten)
  * Fix a bug that the ball is hold by goalie if the 2nd half is
    end in draw.
    (reported by Oliver Obst)

[5.21]
  * Fix a bug that logplayer cannot be compiled on SunOS4.

[5.20]
  * Fix a bug that the goalie can not kick the ball after a catch
    if the ball is far.
    Now, the ball is moved to the next of the goalie after a successful catch.

[5.19]
  * The value of half_time in server.conf is corrected for
    the RoboCup-99's regulation.
  * Fix a bug of logplayer. (Patched by Gerhard Sander).
  * Add rec_msg_mode flag to the server to reduce the size of logfile
    (Contributed by Patrick F. Riley).
  * Fix a bug that the server executes turn_neck commands exclusively with
    turn, dash and kick commands.
  * Fix a bug that some players remain in side of 9.15m from the offside line
    after offside call (Reported Klaus Dorer).
  * Fix a bug the server can not parse "offside_kick_margin" line
    in "server.conf" file.

[5.18]
  * Fix a bug of neck directions and turn_neck commands.
  * "Move" commands after catch moves the goalie and the ball
    keeping the relative position between them.
  * When the referee calls "offside", the server move offside players
    to 9.15m behind from the offside-line.  Y-position is kept.
    (Previously, the server moved them to random position.)
  * An offline coach can set the velocity by "move" command.
  * Fix a bug that the server crashs in some situation.
  * All information of "sense_body" and "see" reflects values after the server
    commits the commands at the end of a simulation cycle.
  * The values of stamina_max and stamina_inc_max in the default "server.conf"
    file are set for RoboCup-99's regulations.
  * Limit the value of turn_neck and angle_neck.

[5.17]
  * Fix a bug of behavior after goalie's catch command.
  * Fix a bug in functions defined in utility.h.

[5.16]
  * Fix spelling miss of "illigal".

[5.15]
  * Normal coach (not online coach) becomes to be able to use
    "(eye on/off)" command.

[5.14.1]
  * Fix a bug that the server moves players wrong side when
    the second catch command occer.

[5.14]
  * Fix a bug that the server move players to wrong place at a goal kick.
  * Fix a bug that the human referee can not take free kick during
    a goalie catchs a ball.

[5.13]
  * -lbsd option is omited. (Oliver Obst's patch)

[5.12]
  * Fix a bug that the server does not accept "drop ball" during
    a goalie catch a ball.

[5.11]
  * Fix a bug that coach and online-coach receives direction in radian.
  * Fix a bug that the server coredump when a client send a turn_neck
    immediately after establishing the connection.

[5.10]
  * Change the direct number "11" to "MAX_PLAYER" in source file
    for generalization.

[5.09]
  * online coach can use two ways to get visual information:
	(1) (look) protocol
		The coach requires the information actively
		every time it needs.
		As same as off-line coach, the coach client
		sends a "(look)" command, then the server
		returns "(ok look ...)" with all absolute positions of
		objects.
	(2) (eye on/off) protocol
		When the coach sends a "(eye on)" command,
		then the server starts to send "(see ...)" information
		every 100ms (the interval is specified by send_vi_step
		parameter) automatically to the client.
		When the coach sends a "(eye off)" command,
		then the server stops to send.
  * Add new option "-redraw_player (on/off)" to soccermonitor.
    Then soccermonitor redraw player widgets every cycle.
    This option is for avoid a bug of XFree86 server for SVGA,
    and it makes soccermonitor heavy.
    So, it is better do not use this option when soccermonitor
    works well without the option.

[5.08]
  * The server accepts "(look)" commands from on-line coach.
  * Fix a bug that sampleclient can not be compiled on Linux.

[5.07]
  * Push out opponent players from a penalty area when
    a goal kick occer.
  * Goalie can use "(move X Y)" command after catching the ball.
  * Fix a bug of the version control in sense_body information.
  * on-line coach get visual information in "(see ...)" format
    rather than "(ok look ...)" format.
  * Fix a mistake of a name of option in server.conf file.
	(look_step -> send_vi_step)

[5.06]
  * Fix a bug that head-angle is reported in float value.
  * Fix a bug about wrong initialization of turn_neck.
  * Fix a bug that distance to the player is reported twice.
  * Parameters in "server.conf" is modified for RoboCup99.
  * On-line coach mode is added.
    In order to start on-line coach,
	* An on-line coach client sends "(init team-name)" to
	  the port 6002/UDP of the server.
 	* The client can use "(look)" and "(say)" commands.
	  "(look)" command returns with visual information.
 	  "(say)" command broadcase the message to the all player client.
	* Also, the coach client can use "(say)" commands
  * An on-line coach receives information about positions of players and
    ball in absolute coodinate system (x-y coordinate system).
  * An on-line coach become not to use "move" and "change-mode" commands.

[5.04]
  * Version Control
  * Fix the offside bug that the server moves players to the wrong side.
  * Add information about player's body- and head-direction and velosity
    into data that a coach client gets.
  * Sense-body information sends every 100ms.
    The interval is able to be modified by command-line option "-???"
  * Fix a bug that head-angle is reported in radian.

[5.03]
  * Fix a bug that the server reports head_angle in radiants.
  * Fix a bug that the server move players to wrong place after offside call.

[5.02]
  * Fix the bug that offensive players move into offside areas when
    offside is called by the referee.
  * Fix the bug that players can not move before kickoff.
  * Fix the bug that (turn_neck Angle) commands turns wrong directon of angle.
    (In the regulation, Angle should be positive value when he/she will
    turn his/her neck right.)
  * Fix the bug that inconsistency about angles of lines.
  * `sense_body' information includes the following information:
	* the number of executed turn_neck commands.
		(turn_neck XXX)
	* the angle of head relative to the body.
		(head_angle XXX)
  * Format about players in visual information are changed as follows:

	((player TEAM UNUM) Distance Direction DistChng DirChng
		BodyFacingDir HeadFacingDir)

[5.01]
  * Operation after offside call is modified.
	When offside is called,  offending players inside of 9.15m from
	the ball and in the offside area are moved back to onside area.
  * Clearance at goal-kicks is modified.
	When goal-kick, all offending player can not enter the penalty area.
	The play-mode does not turn to play-on until the ball goes out
	of the penalty area.
  * All body commands (turn, dash, kick, and catch) have its effects
    at the end of simulation cycle.

[5.00]
  * Neck is introduced.
	A player have a neck.
	A client can use "(turn_neck ANGLE)" command to turn the neck.
	ANGLE is added to the current neck-angle.
	possible neck-angle is [-90,90] (parameterized)
	The neck-angle is relative to the direction of body,
	so that when a client "(turn X)", then the view angle also
	turns X degrees.
	A client can use "neck" commands with turn, dash, kick in the same
	simulation cycle.
  * Backward Dash
	A player can dash backword more powerful (for example, (dash -100)),
	but consumes doubled stamina.
  * sense_body
	Sense_body information is sent automatically in every 100ms.

[4.21]
  * Shuffle the order of recv_from for of clients to equalize chances
    of kicking ball.
  * When the soccerserver runs with "-send_log off" option, then
    the server does not send information about communication between
    the server and clients to soccermonitors.
    This option reduces network trafic.
  * When the soccermonitor runs with "-eval on" option, then
    the server runs as evaluation mode.  In the evaluation mode,
    a user can discard a player from the pull-down menu on the monitor.

[4.20]
  * Fix a bug reported by David Andre about drop-ball.
  * Official Version used in RoboCup98 Paris

[4.19]
  * Fix a bug in offside judgement reported by Milind Tambe.

[4.18]
  * Fix a bug that the server does not accept second player in team-r.
  * Fix a typo reported by soccer@cs-gw.utcluj.ro.

[4.17]
  * Fix a bug of judging offside and its restart-position.
  * Install team `bench's.
    Now, 11 players of each team are standing at their bench
    even before (init) commands are received.
    When the server receives a (bye) command, it move the player
    to the bench.
  * The server does not receive (reconnect) commands in play-on mode.
  * Fix a bug in the definition of ReducedDashPower(p).
  * The server saves rediced-size logfile.  This algorithm is
    contributed by Mr. Klaus Dorer (klaus@cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de).
    You can select the old format of logfile and Klaus's format by
    a new option "-record_version [1|2]", where '1' is old format and
    '2' is Klaus's format.

[4.16]
  * Offside is called in the following condition.
	+ An offside player aproachs to the ball in 9.15m.
	+ The offside player is the nearest player in the offending team.
  * When offside is called, the server restarts the match from
    the nearest point on the offside line from the position where
    the offside player was when the passer kicked the ball.
  * Add the following flags about collision to the protocol from
    soccerserver to soccermonitor:

	dinfo.body.show.pos[i].enable = PLAYER_TO_BALL (0x40)
					BALL_TO_PLAYER (0x80)

[4.15]
  * Fix a bug that the server does not disconnect correctly when "(bye)"
    command is received.

[4.14]
  * Inertia moment parameter (IMPARAM in source of the previous version)
    becomes a command-line parameter named "inertia_moment".
  * Reduce double definition of 'turn()' method for MPObject class and
    Player class.  Now, only Player class has 'turn()' method.
  * Fix the bug that a player initialized by version 3 can not see
    players initialized by version 4.
  * The referee restarts a match after 'offside' from position
    where the offending player was when the passer kicked the ball.
  * Add play-modes for offside.
    When 'offside' occers, the server changes the playmode to "offside_l"
    or "offside_r" (referee's message), and suspend the match 3 seconds,
    with a popup window, and restart the match.
    The following new options are introduced:
	-offside_label_width WIDTH
	-offside_label_font FONT
  * Change the name of an option "-print_goal" to "-popup_msg".
    When "-popup_msg on", the server displays both popup windows of
    "Goal!!" and "Offside!".  Else, the server does not use popup windows.
    Default is "on".
  * New option "-ball_file FILE", which specifies the file of a bitmap
    picture of ball, is introduced.
  * Soccermonitor display kicking players with double circle,
    and catching goalies with filled circle.
  * Goalies are displayed different color.
    You can specify the color by "-goalie_l_color COLOR" and
    "-goalie_r_color COLOR" option.
  * Protocol from soccerserver to soccermonitor is changed as follow:
	dinfo.body.show.pos[i].enable = DISABLE     (0x00)
					STAND       (0x01)
					KICK        (0x02)
					KICK_FAULT  (0x04)
					GOALIE      (0x08)
					CATCH       (0x10)
					CATCH_FAULT (0x20)
    Actual value is bit-or of these information.
  * Fix the bug that re-connected players can not be seen in monitor
    when the player disconnected by a "(bye)" command.
  * Equation about stamina written in [4.00] is wrong.
	    /* consume stamina by dash */
	     effective_dash_power = effort * dash_power
	     stamina -= effective_dash_power
    should be
	    /* consume stamina by dash */
	     effective_dash_power = effort * dash_power
	     stamina -= fabs(dash_power)

[4.13]
  * Small modification was done just for distribution.

[4.12]
  * Used RoboCup Japan Open 98.
  * When offside rule is applied, the server restarts the game
    from the point where the offside player received the ball.
    In the previous implementation, the server restarts the game
    from the point where the passer kicked the ball.
  * Change configure script.
    If the new configure script does not work well, please use
    configure2 script that is the same as the old configure script.

[4.11]
  * Fix the condition of offside.  The correct offside position is:
	(1) between the center line and the opponent goal line.
	(2) between the ball and the opponent goal line.
 	(3) between the second defender and the opponent goal line.

[4.10]
  * Fix the following bug of checking offside.
    The server judged offside even if a player try to do free-kick,
    corner-kick, etc.
  * Change the name of option 'permit_kick_off_offside' to
    'forbit_kick_off_offside'.

[4.09]
  * Use Xlib instead of Xt to display players and ball in soccermonitor.
    So, soccermonitor becomes light so that even laptop machines can
    display soccermonitor without fricker.

[4.08]
  * New command line option "-verbose [on/off]" is introduced.
    Then soccerserver is invoked with "-verbose on" then
    the server reports some trouble-messages like "recvfrom error".
    If "-verbose off" then the server does not reports such warning.
    The default is "off".

[4.07]
  * Corrct the positions of flags of goal-posts.
    In version 4.06 and before, the positions is calculated from
    constant value of default goal width rather than the parameter in
    "server.conf" file.

[4.06]
  * Fit the code to calculate actual kick-power to the description
    in [4.02] of this list.  This was pointed out by Peter Stone.

[4.05]
  * Fix a bug that 'move' command does not work in version 4.04.

[4.04]
  * Speed value in sense_body is quantized by 0.01.
  * New flags introduced in version 4 are invisible for clients
    who init by version 3.0.
  * Fix a bug some value in 'see' information becomes NaN.
  * Fix a bug of stamina model.
  * Clients can not specify goalie mode or version at 'reconnect'.
  * Null char is written '\000' instead of 'NULL'.
  * The server warns when a client use too long teamname in 'init'.
  * '-nowindow' and '-nw' for logplayer' option are the same.
  * The server does not return '(error unknow_command)' when
    a client sends more than one command in a simulation cycle.

[4.03a,b]
  * Fix a bug of configure.
  * Fix a bug to fail to compile server/field.C.
  * Fix a bug in scanning init command.
  * Change the formula to decide kick_power_rate as follows:
	kick-power-rate := max-kick-power-rate *
			(1 -
			 0.25 * |dirDiference|/180 -
			 0.25 * (distBallPlayer - BallSize - PlayerSize)/
			 	kick_margin)
  * No window mode of logplayer.
    When logplayer is invoked with -nowindow option,
    it start without window and accept commands from the standard input.
    Possible commands are as follows:
		play [FROM] [to TO]
			Play from FROM to TO in normal speed.
			If FROM > TO, it plays backword.
			FROM and TO should be integer, 'here'(current counter),
			or 'end' (last of the log).
		feed to TO
			Feed forward until TO.
			When TO is less than the current counter,
			It rewind to TO.
		feed {+|-}COUNT
			Feed {+|-}COUND steps.
		jump to TO
			Jump to TO without displaying.
		jump {+|-}COUNT
			Jump to {+|-}COUNT without displaying.
		step [COUNT]
			play COUNT steps.
		sleep SECOND
			sleep SECOND seconds.
			SECOND should be positive integer or forever.
		quit
			quit and finish loplayer.
  * Fix a small bug of X interface in logplayer.

[4.03]
  * The server parse `init' command more correctly.
  * Reform the configure script.
  * Fix minor bugs in logplayer.

[4.02]
  * Kick command accerelate the velosity of the ball rather than sets it.
  * Maximum ball speed is introduced.
	max_ball_speed = 32
    When the ball speed becomes larger than this, the speed is reduced
    to this maximum speed.
    Player also have a maximum speed.
  * 'kick_power_rate' is calculated in the following way.
	kick-power-rate := max-kick-power-rate * (1 -
                   0.25 *  |dirDifference|/180 -
                   0.25 * distBallPlayer / controlRadiusWidth

     where
	  dirDifference := the angle between the view direction of the
        	           player and the ball position

	  distBallPlayer := the distance between the edge of the player
	                    and the ball
	  controlRadiusWidth := control_radius - player_size
  * 'sense_body' information includes the following information:
	(kick KICK_COUNT)
	(dash DASH_COUNT)
	(turn TURN_COUNT)
	(say SAY_COUNT)
    Each of them tell how many commands are executed.
  * `goalie_catch_probability', the probability that a goalie succeed
    to catch the ball by a catch command is introduced. (default is 1)

[4.01]
  * Minor change of logplayer window.

[4.00]
  [Major Changes]
  * Version control by init command.
    When a client connects the server with '(init TEAMNAME (version 4.00))',
    the server uses the new protocols for the client.
    If the client sends only '(init TEAMNAME)' then the server uses
    the old (version 3.2x) protocol.
  * Goalie
    When a client connects the server with '(init TEAMNAME (goalie)',
    the client becomes a goalies.  The goalie can use '(catch DIR)' command
    that enable to capture the ball in the following rectangle area:

			    ___
		**********   |
		G*********   W   ---> DIR
		**********   |
			    ~~~
		|<---L--->|
    where
	W : GOALIE_CATCHABLE_AREA_W (default 1)
	L : GOALIE_CATCHABLE_AREA_L (default 2)
    The goalie can not use catch commands GOALIE_CATCH_DEC cycles after
    it uses a catch command.
    Only a goalie is available in a team.
  * Kick command set the ball velocity rather than accelerate it.
  * A new command, 'sense_body', which tells internal status of a player
    in the following way:
	(sense_body) ->
		(sense_body TIME (view_mode QUALTY WIDTH)
				 (stamina STAMINA EFFORT)
				 (speed AMOUNT_OF_SPEED))
  * The server executes one of kick, turn or dash command in a simulation
    cycle.
    Other commands (say, change_view, sense_body) are executable in the same
    cycle.
  * Offside rule is introduced.
    The algorithm is as follows:
	(1) When a player of team-X kick a ball,
	    players of team-X in offside position are
	    marked ``offside''.
	(2) When a player marked ``offside'' try to kick the ball,
	    the referee judges ``offside!!''.
	(3) ``offside'' mark is cleared by each effective kick.
    where, `offside options' is:
	(1) in the opponent side
	(2) between the ball and the opponent goal line
	(3) between the second defending player and the goal line.
    The user can turn off this offside rule by '-use_offside off' option.
  * Long term stamina is introduced as follows
    /* recover-stamina phase */
     if( stamina <= 0.3*max_stamina ){
       if( recovery <= 0.1 ){
         /* do nothing */;
       else
         recovery -= .05;
     if( stamina <= 0.4*max_stamina ){
       if( effort <= 0.1 )
          /* do nothing */;
       else
          effort -= .05;
     if( stamina >= 0.9*max_stamina ){
       if( effort >= 1.0 ){
         /* do nothing */;
       else
         effort += .05;
     stamina += recovery * maximum_recovery

    /* consume stamina by dash */
     effective_dash_power = effort * dash_power
     stamina -= effective_dash_power
  * New Landmarks
	center mark	(flag c)
	goal posts	(flag g l t)	left-top
			(flag g l b)	left-bottom
			(flag g r t)	right-top
			(flag g r b)	right-bottom
	flags outside of the pitch
			(flag TB LR XX)
			(flag LR TB YY)
				TB ::= [t|b]
				LR ::= [l|r]
				XX ::= [10|20|30|40|50]
				YY ::= [10|20|30]
			(flag TBLR 0)
				TBLR ::= [t|b|l|r]
		These flags are located at 5 meter outside from the
		edge of the pitch.
		For example, (flag t l 20) is 5 meters above from the top
		touch line and 20 meters left from the center line.
		In the same way (flag r b 10) is 5 meters right from the right
		goal line and 10 meters below from the center of right goal.
		In the similar way, (flag b 0) is 5 meters below from the
		midpoint of bottom touch line, and (flag l 0) is 5 meters
		left from the center of the left goal.
 * Default visual sensing time is 150ms.
 * Visual information about a player tells its facing direction
   in the following format.
     ((player TEAMNAME UNUM) DISTANCE DIRECTION DISTCHANGE DIRCHANGE FACEDIR)
   where FACEDIR is the relative facing direction.
   For example,

	P=>	<=Q		... Q's FACEDIR is 180

	P=>	Q		... Q's FACEDIR is 90
		v

  [Minor Changes]
  * Fix a bug that stamina increase when a player dashs with negative power.
  * If the server is invoked with '-permit_kick_off_offside off' option,
    the server does not permit for players to enter the opponent sides.

[3.32]
  * UDP port number used in logplayer is changed by -port PORT option.

[3.31]
  * The following drawing facility is added to soccermonitor.
    	- draw point
	- draw line
	- draw circle
  * Delete all code for Motif.

[3.30]
  * Stepwise replay functions is added to 'logplayer'.
  * Refine the interface of logplayer.
  * Kickable margin (1.0m) becomes a parameter that can be specifiled
    in a conf file for soccerserver.

[3.29]
  * A logfile includes informaiton about communication between clients and
    the server when soccerserver is invoked with '-record_log on' option.
    If you need not the information in the log file (only for information
    about locations of players and the ball), the server should be invoked
    with '-record_log off' option.
  * Logplayer accepts multiple monitor.

[3.23--3.28] (These modification was done on site of RoboCup-97 :-)
  * Force players in their own sides before kick-off.
  * Change to use larger fonts.

[3.22a]
  * Fix a typo in monitor/field.C

[3.22]
  * Fix a bug that the server does not record a log file when no monitor
    is running.  [contributed by William Webber, RMIT]

[3.21]
  * A small change in pop-up window when a team get a goal.

[3.20]
  * Stamina and hear_capacity is refleshed at the begining of
    the 2nd half.

[3.19]
  * The file of image on the field is changable by -mark_file_name
    option.  Default file is "mark.xbm".

[3.18]
  * A radius of kickable area was decided by constants in previous
    versions.  Now, the radius is decided actual parameters of
    ball_size and player_size.

[3.17]
  * Now, an image appears on the field.  By default, RoboCup logo appears.
    The image file is monitor/mark.xbm.
    You can turn off this facility by specifying "print_mark off" option
    on the command line or configulation file for soccermonitor.
  * When a team gets a goal, a popup menu labeled "Goal!!".
    You can turn off this facility by specifying "print_goak off" option
    on the command line or configulation file for soccermonitor.

[3.16]
  * Small change in popuping foul menu.

[3.15]
  * Fix a bug repoted by Sean Luke.  The bug is:
	In 3.13 and earlier versions a negative number will cause the server
	to incorrectly do time_over after a goal is made. This is because it
	is comparing the current time with the (negative) half_time time, and
	the current time is much greater, so it thinks the game is over.

[3.14]
  * Small modification of soccermonitor to avoid the bug (maybe) of X11R5.
    soccermonitor becomes to use XtSetVaue() instead of XtMoveWidget().

[3.13]
  * Fix a bug that the server does not keep out defending players from the
    center circle when the server already receives some "kick" commands.

[3.12]
  * Add an option of "drop_ball" in foul menu that pop-ups when
    an user clicks a mouse on the field.  When you choose "drop_ball",
    then:
	(1) The referee announce "drop_ball" to all player.
 	(2) It moves the ball to the mouse cursor.
	(3) Players are moved to keep 9.15m away from the ball.
	(4) The referee restarts the match.
  * The margin of corner kick (default is 1m) becomes to be modified
    by command-line options or the configuration file.
    The name of the option is "ckick_margin".

[3.11]
  * Change the format of pop-up menu when an user clicks a mouse on
    the field.
  * The point to restart a match by a corner-kick is changed to
    (1m,1m) inside from the corner.

[3.10]
  * Fix a bug of the foul menu introduced in version 3.09.  The bug
    is that the server core-dumps when a user click out of the field.

[3.09]
  * The process to take a foul by a human referee is changed.
    Previously, the human referee must click on a player who does foul.
    Now, the human referee clicks at the point on the field where the
    game restarts.  Then a menu pop-ups and select a team that will
    do a free-kick.

[3.08]
  * Player's "hear_capacity" becomes to recover constantly
    when the simulation clock stops before a match, during half-time,
    and after a goal.  Previously, hear_capacity recovered only when
    simulation clock was running, so that, players could not communicate
    with each other after a goal, for example.  Now,  players can
    communicate during such out-of-play time.

[3.07]
  * A player becomes to be able to hear its own message without
    exhausting its hearing capacity.
    So, the player can hear a message from a teammate just after saying
    something.

[3.06]
  * Fix a bug that a player can kick a ball after a goal.
    Now, players can never kick a ball for 5 seconds between a goal
    and the next kick-off.
  * Fix a bug that the server sometimes accepts more than one command in
    one simulation cycle (100ms).
    Now, the server accepts one command in one simulation cycle at most.

[3.05]
  * "logplayer" becomes to support X11R5.
  * In order to make sure to set the velocity of the ball to zero,
    the server moves the ball to the center mark at the end of first half.
  * The value of goal_width in "monitor.conf" is now 14.02, which is
    consistent value in "server.conf".
  * Revise "sserver" shell script to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the path of
    tcsh correctly.
  * "soccermonitor" becomes to support X11R5 correctly.

[3.04]
  * Fix a bug of "XtDestroyApplicationContext" problem in
    soccermonitor for Solaris.
  * Fix a bug of zero-divide problem in relative movement values in
    visual information.  Version 3.03 sometimes sends the following
    visual information.

	(see 0 ((goal r) 52.5 0) .... ((ball) 0 0 NaN NaN) ...

    In some platforms, the server core-dumps because of the same reason.
    Now, this problem is fixed.
  * Change Makefile in order not to make logplayer in the case of X11R5,
    because logplayer does not support X11R5.
  * The server moves players into their own side at kick-off if they are
    in the opponent side.
  * Quantization unit for dir_change becomes small, so that clients
    can know more detailed information about relative movements.
  * Fix a bug of information about near-objects.
    In version 3.03, information about near-objects (objects near to the
    player and out of view-cone) includes dist_change and dir_change.
    This is not fit to the regulation for RoboCup-97.  Now, the server
    only sends distance and direction about near-objects.
  * Change the value of kick_power_rate in server.conf from 0.02 to 0.013,
    because a player can shoot the ball to a goal from the center circle
    in the previous setting.

[3.03]
  * The server becomes to inform about relative movements
    of flags and goals in visual information.

[3.02]
  * The following bug is fixed.
	The server coredumps when move two objects to the same place.

  * The server ignores 'kick' commands 5 seconds after a goal, which
    is the period that players go back to their home position.

[3.01]
  * The following bug is fixed.
	Information about relative movements of objects in the "see"
	information is wrong.  Even if the player and objects stop,
	"see" information returns non-zero values of DistChange and
	DirChange.
  * The following bug is fixed.
	The server controls the players' capacity of hearing message
	in the wrong way.

[3.00]
  * The format each object in 'see' information is changed as following.
	(ObjName Distance Direction DistChange DirChange)
    where DistChange and DirChange mean amount of changes of Distance
    and Direction respectively.
  * Quantize step for visual and movable objects (players and the ball)
    is now 0.1 rather than 0.01.  This means that the accuracy of
    the distance information is low when the object is far from the player.
  * The player can see all objects that is within 3m from the player.
    In this case, the player can know the type , the distance and the
    direction of the object, but can not know the name of the object.
    Actually, the player gets the following information.

	(ObjType Distance Direction)
	ObjType ::= (Flag) | (Ball) | (Goal) | (Player)
  * During 5 seconds between a goal and kick-off, the client can use
    'move' commands to come back home.

[2.93]
  * Stamina is treated in the same scale as power parameters in dash commands.
    Previously, the stamina was treated in the scale of power multiplied
    a small constant.
  * Each player can hear N messages during M simulation cycles.
    N and M is decided from the parameter `hear_max', `hear_decay'
    and `hear_inc' as follows:
	M = (hear_max)/(hear_inc)
	N = (hear_max)/(hear_decay)
    This limitation is effective only for messages from players.
    The player always can hear messages from the referee.

[2.92]
  * The process after a team gets a goal is changed as follow:

	(1) The referee broadcasts "goal_SIDE_POINT".
	(2) During 50 simulation steps, the player must return its own side
	    to restart the game.  During this interval, the clock is stopped
 	    and the ball stays in the goal.
	(3) If players are in the opponent side after the interval,
	    the referee move them into their own side randomly.
	(4) The referee broadcasts "kick_off_SIDE".
  * The wind brows to the reverse direction in the second half.
    This means it seems that two teams exchange the side excepts the
    name of landmarks.
  * 'soccermonitor' displays the field upside down in the second half.
    This change is only in 'soccermonitor', but there is no change
    in 'soccerserver'.  Therefore, you need not change the client
    at the halftime.

[2.91]
  * Two new features 'BLANK' and 'RECORD' is added to `logplayer'.
    These feature are useful for editing the logfile.  Start logplayer
    as following:

	% logplayer LOGFILE -out NEWLOGFILE

    Then, you can make new log file (=NEWLOGFILE) by pushing RECORD button.

  * A new command "(bye)" for clients.  When a client sends "(bye)" to
    the server, the server deletes its player from the field.

[2.90]
  * A new utility, logplayer, is included.  Using this, you can replay a
    logfile of soccerserver.  It can play, pause, feed-forward and rewind
    like video.  The usage of logplayer is:

	% logplayer LOGFILE

  * The main script 'sserver' is modified for tcsh.
  * A player can see all lines in its view.  Previously, the player can see
    only the nearest line.  Now, the player can see two lines when it is
    out of the pitch and facing to the pitch.
  * A message from a player is informed only to players with a certain
    distance from the player.  The distance is specified by
    'audio_cut_dist' in "server.conf" or a command line-options.
    Messages from the referee and the coach is informed to all players.
  * Little change of the alignment of bottoms in the window.

[2.89]
  * When the ball is stopping (the velocity is less than BALL_T_VEL(=0.001)),
    the value of VDirection of the ball in the "see" information is -360.
    The client becomes to be able to detect the ball is moving or stopping.
  * The weather (wind) factor is implemented.  The wind forces objects
    (ball and players) to accelerate a certain direction.  The parameters of
    the wind is:

	wind_force	(0 -- 100) 	The power of the wind
	wind_dir	(-180 -- 180) 	The direction of the wind
	wind_rand	(0 -- 100)	The degree of the change of direction
					during a match
     These parameters are specified in the "server.conf" or options
     in a command line.  The server also permits the following options:

	-wind_none		Ignore wind factor.
	-wind_random		Set these parameters randomly

     In addition to it, the following new parameter about the weight of
     objects is introduced.

	ball_weight	(default 0.2)
	player_weight   (default 60.0)

[2.88]
  * Add a converter of recorded log file of communication between
    soccerserver and soccermonitor into the package.  The converter is
    under the directory recfile_change.  The usage is,

	% recfile_change log_in_old_format log_in_new_format

    It supports reverse conversion like

	% recfile_change -old log_in_new_format log_in_old_format

[2.87]
 * A coach client receives hear messages in the same format as players
   receive.  If the server invoked with -old_coach_hear, it receives
   the old format.
 * Communication between soccerserver and soccermonitor becomes machine
   independent.

[2.86]
 * The small changes for preRoboCup. Please ignore.
   (If compile soccerserver with -DWRONG_LINE_VIEW option,
    the server sends visual information about lines in the old format
    (before Ver. 2.83).)

[2.85]
 * The size of goal that soccermonitor displays becomes changeable.
   If you starts soccermonitor with -goal_width option like:

	% soccermonitor -goal_width 14.64
   then the goal displayed in the specified width.
 * Avoid a bug of XtVaSetValues function in old X11R5.
   Some old version of X11R5 has buggy XtVaSetValues function.
   So, the program use XtMoveWidget rather than the function
   In the case of X11R5.
 * Do call signal() function before setitimer() function.
   This change is to avoid that the server sometimes
   terminates by ALARM signal.
 * When a player is judged FOUL by mouse, the player is moved 9.15m
   away from the ball automatically.


[2.84]
 * Fix the bug that a client receive wrong visual information about lines
   when the player is out of the field.
 * Change over-writing log files rather than appending them.

[2.83]
 * Add a new option to record and replay process of a match.
   When a soccerserver is invoked with the following options,
   the server saves data for soccerdisplay into a specified logfile.
	% soccerserver -record LOGFILE
   Then, soccerserver replays the process of the match by invoked
   as follows:
	% soccerserver -replay LOGFILE
 * Support IRIX 5.

[2.82]
 * Add a new option to save log-file of messages between the server
   and clients.
   When soccerserver is invoked with the following options,
   messages (control-commands and sensor-informations) are saved
   into a specified log file.
	% soccerserver -log_file LOGFILE

[2.81]
 * Team colors becomes changeable.
   When soccermonitor is invoked with the following options,
   each team is displayed with the specified color.
	% soccermonitor -team_l_color "purple" -team_r_color "blue"
 * Fix the bug that the referee judges wrong goal.

[2.80]
 * Fix the bug that the server core-dumps when no players entry and
   the match ends.
 * Fix the bug that a match sometimes does not suspend at the half-time
   and the time-up.
 * Fix the bug the server returns error for coach's change_mode command.

[2.79]
 * Fix the bug that the monitor goes down when the server receives
   too long messages.

[2.78a]
 * Correct the value of half_time parameter.

[2.78]
 * Add noise to MOMENT parameter in 'turn' command.
 * Change the referee's message string "entyo" to "time_extended",
   which is broadcast when the second half ends in a draw.
 * Fix a bug that a match is sometimes not suspended when the half time
   comes.
 * Fix a bug that the referee sometimes calls a goal when the ball
   goes out from the side line.

[2.77]
 * Fix a bug of judgment of goal.
   In the version 2.76, the server sometimes judges the right side team
   gets a score even when the left side team gets a goal.

[2.76]
 * The port number for a coach client becomes modifiable by a configuration
   file for soccerserver. ('coach_port' option)
 * The server starts to use a more precise algorithm of judging a goal.
   Previously, the server judges a goal when the ball is in a goal-region
   after it moves.  Now, the server judges a goal when the ball cross a
   goal line between goal posts.

[2.75]
 * Parameters of move commands change to mean relative position.
   In other words, (move -10 -10) means left-forward in both cases of
   left and right teams.
 * Maximum length of message in say and hear commands can be specified
   by a command line option or configuration file.

[2.74]
 * The server becomes to execute only one command per player in a
   simulation cycle.

[2.73]
 * Execute XFlush every cycle.
 * Support Linux.
 * Include Peter's config file.

[2.72]
 * Execute Xflush everytime when each player changes the position.
 * Support NEWS-OS 4.2.1R
 * Fix a bug of change_view.

[2.71]
 * Add -coach_w_referee mode.
 * Change the format of "see" information when the low-quality is specified
   by change_view commands.
	(OBJNAME DIR [VDIR]) -> (OBJNAME DIR)

[2.70]
 * Change the name of flags to fit to the description in the manual.
	(flag [t|b])   -->  (flag c [t|b])
 * Polish up Makefile
 * Fix the bug that soccermonitor does not display log of communications.
 * Fix the bug that the server core-dumps when the 22nd client connects
   with the server.
 * Fix the bug that the server can not read the configuration files.
